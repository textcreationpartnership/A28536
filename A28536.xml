         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>The Firſt Chapter.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen wee conſider the beginning of our Life, and compare the ſame with the Eternall Life, which we have in the promiſe; we cannot ſay nor finde that we are at home in this life. For we ſee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end of the outward life, as alſo the totall decay and finall corruption of our bodies: and beſides we ſee or know of no returning into this [outward] life, neither have we any promiſe of it from the high and eternall Good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing then there is a Life in us which is Eternall and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, wherewith we ſtrive after the higheſt Good; and a life (from this world) which is finite and corruptible, and alſo a life in which the ſource &amp; originall cauſe of Life ſtandeth, wherin the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger of Eternall Perdition, miſery, and calamity doth conſiſt; therefore it is of neceſſity that we conſider the beginning of Life, from whence all theſe things proceed and have their originall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So now when we conſider the life, what it is; then we finde that it is a burning Fire, which conſumeth, and when it hath no more [fuell] to feed upon, it goeth out: as may be ſeene in all Fires. For the life hath its nouriſhment from the body, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from the food, for when the body hath no more food, then it is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61125:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> conſumed by the fire of the life, ſo that it fadeth and periſheth, as a faire flower when it hath no water, withereth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But ſeeing there is in Man a life which is Eternall and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, which is the ſoule, which is alſo a Fire, and hath need of nutriment as well as the Elementary life hath therefore we ought to conſider the property and food of that life, what that is which continually feedeth it, ſo that it never goeth out in Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And thirdly we finde in the life of our ſoules, that there is in it a greater hunger after another higher and better life, <hi>viz.</hi> after the higheſt Good, which is called the <hi>Divine Life:</hi> inſomuch that the ſoule is not contented with its own food, but it deſireth with great longing and panting, the higheſt and beſt Good, not only for a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant habitation, but in a hunger for a food.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And ſo now we perceive in our very great and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that every life deſireth its [own] Mother (out of which the life is generated) for a food; as the Wood which is the Mother of the Fire, that the Fire deſireth to have, and if it be ſevered from its Mother it goeth out. In like manner, the Earth is the Mother of all Trees and hearbs, and they deſire it; and the water (with the other Elements) is the Mother of the Earth, or elſe it would be dead [or barren], and there would grow neither metalls, trees, hearbs, nor graſſe out of it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We ſee eſpecially, that the Elementary life conſiſteth in a boyling, and is a [kinde of] ſeething, and when it leaveth boyling it goeth out: alſo we know that the Conſtellations kindle the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Starres are the Fire of the Elements, and the Sunne kindleth the Starres, ſo that there is a boyling and ſeething amongſt them: but the Elementary life is finite and corruptible, and the life of the ſoule is Eternall.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Now ſeeing it is Eternall, therefore it muſt alſo be from the Eternall: as the deare <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written very rightly of it; <hi>That God breathed into Man the living breath, and ſo Man is become a living ſoule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Yet we cannot ſay, though indeed Man ſtandeth in <hi>a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Life,</hi> that each life is apart in a ſeverall forme: but we finde that they are in one another, and yet each life hath its own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Dominion; <hi>viz.</hi> in its Mother: For as God the Father is all, becauſe all cometh from him, and he is preſent every where, and is the fullneſſe of every thing, and the thing doth not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, alſo the thing is not God, nor his Spirit, nor the true <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence;</hi> ſo that it cannot be ſaid of any comprehenſible thing, that it is God, or that God is here preſent, more then in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet he is really preſent, he containeth the thing, and the thing containeth not him, he comprehendeth the thing; and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61125:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing comprehendeth not him; for he dwelleth not in the thing; but in himſelfe, <hi>in another Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. So alſo is the ſoule of Man breathed in from God, it dwelleth in the body, and is invironed with the Spirit of the Starres and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not onely as a Garment covereth the body, but it is infected with the Spirit of the Starres and Elements, as the Peſtilence or other [infectious] diſeaſe infecteth the Elementary Spirit, ſo that it poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth its body, and ſo it decayeth and dyeth, and then the ſource [or property] of the Starres alſo breaketh it ſelfe off from the ſoule, and conſumeth it ſelfe: whrereby the Elementary Mother breaketh off, and ſo the Spirit of the Starres hath no more food, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſumeth it ſelfe, but the ſoule remaineth<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> Crude, empty, or feeble, or faint.</note> naked, becauſe it liveth by another food.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Underſtand us here in this manner; though the ſoule be thus captivated with the Spirit of the Starres and Elements; ſo that the ſource [or property] thereof dwelleth in the ſoule, yet the ſoule hath another food, and liveth in another Principle, and is another [thing or]<note n="b" place="margin">Beeing or ſubſtance.</note> beeing.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. For its Eſſences [or the faculties or powers of its ſubſtance] are <hi>not</hi> from the <hi>Conſtellation,</hi> but have their beginning, and corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all union out of the <hi>Eternall Band,</hi> out of the Eternall Nature, which is Gods, the Fathers, before the light of his Love, wherein he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into himſelfe, and maketh to himſelfe the ſecond Principle in his Love; out of which he continually generateth his Eternall Word and Heart, from Eternity to Eternity: where the holy name of God continually ariſeth [or diſcovereth it ſelfe] and holdeth its <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as a Spirit in the ſecond Principle, in it ſelfe, and dwelleth in nothing elſe, but meerly in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. For although the band of the Eternall Nature is in it, yet the Divine Spirit is not ſubjected under that Band; for the Spirit kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that Band, ſo that it becometh enlightened and<note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sprouting.</hi>
                        </note> ſpringing with the vertue of the Light in the Love, in the life of the Word and Heart of God, ſo that it is a holy habitation and Paradiſe of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is called God.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. So alſo the ſoule of Man is out of the band of the Eternall Originall, Eternally ſtanding therein, and deſireth in it ſelfe, in the ſecond Principle, to preſſe into God, and to ſatiate it ſelfe in the Power of God: but becauſe it cannot with its whole beeing (with its own Eſſences) enter into the light and power of God; as little as the Eternall Nature can preſſe into the Light of God, ſo that it may have the light for its own in its own power, but the Light ſhineth out of the Love in its own Principle in the Eternall Nature, ſo that the Light remaineth Lord in the Eternall Nature, becauſe the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Nature doth not comprehend it, but rejoyceth in the Light,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61125:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> and bringeth forth its wonders in the power and underſtanding of the Light, where then they are revealed. Thus alſo the ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in its Eſſences preſſe into the Light of God, and over-maſter it, but muſt in it ſelfe, in another Principle preſſe into God, into his Love.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. For you muſt here underſtand another <hi>new Birth in the ſoule:</hi> for it muſt not onely preſſe forth out of the Life of the Starres and Elements, but alſo out of its own ſource [or property] of life, and incline its will into the Life of God, endeavouring to be therein: this [inclined or] created will is received of God, and God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in that will, and ſo cometh the Divine Life and Light into the ſoule, and ſo it is a childe of God: for it ſtandeth in its ſource [or property] and life, as God the Father himſelfe [doth] in the ſource [or property] of the Eternall Nature.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And here we underſtand, that<note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>beyond.</hi>
                        </note> without the Divine Light (which is the ſecond Principle) in the Eternall Nature there is an anguiſhing ſource [or property]: for the band of life ſtands in the Fire; but when that fire is<note n="e" place="margin">Inficiret, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or filled.</note> inſpired and captivated by the Divine Love, then the life in it ſelf goeth forwards forth into another ſource [or property]: for another Principle is broken open for it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it liveth, and that Life is in God; even as God dwelleth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet is really all himſelfe, all is come from his Nature: yet you muſt underſtand, not as from the Eternall Nature, onely the ſoules and the Angelicall Spirits [are ſo;] but from his<note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                        </note> created will, which hath a beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Externall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every thing of this [outward] world is <hi>Tranſitorie.</hi> And herein we finde the great and terrible Fall of our ſoule in our firſt Parents, that it is entred into the Spirit of this world, into a ſtrange lodging, and hath forſaken the Divine Light, wherein it was an Angel and Childe of God: therefore it muſt goe forth againe out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Starres and Elements, and [paſſe] in a <hi>New Birth,</hi> into the Life of God.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. But becauſe that was not poſſible for the ſoule to doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Life of God came to us out of Love and Grace into the Fleſh, and tooke our humane ſoule againe in it into the Divine Life in the power of the Light, that we might here be able to preſſe into the ſame life to God in a New Birth. For as we went wholly with the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> out from the life of God; (for the children of <hi>Adam</hi> have inherited [all] from their Parents ſoule, being ſprung wholly [from them] as from a Tree) ſo alſo hath the life of God in Chriſt regenerated us againe, ſo that we <hi>can</hi> enter againe in the life of Chriſt into the life of God. And thus now, our ſoule ſtandeth in the Band of the Eternall Originall, infected with the Spirit of this world, and captivated by the wrath of the originall, in the life
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61125:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the eternall fire, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Eternall Nature;</hi> therefore we muſt every one of us by our ſelves, preſſe with our ſoule in the l fe of Chriſt, to God, into the <hi>New Regeneration</hi> in the Life and Spirit of Chriſt: and here no hypocriſie, appearing holineſſe, or any merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works will availe any thing, for the poore ſoule can <hi>no other way be helped,</hi> except it enter into it ſelfe (in a new created will) with ſtedfaſt earneſt purpoſe and reſolution, into the Life of Chriſt: and then it will be received with very great<note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>honour.</hi>
                        </note> Glory by God and his children, in the ſecond Principle; and the noble precious Treaſure (<hi>viz.</hi> the Light of the Eternall Life) will be given to it, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth the ſource, [or property) of the ſoule in the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherein it ſtandeth ſubſtantially with its Eſſences for ever, and turneth the anguiſh into love, and the riſing and burning own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, into an humble lovely mirth in meeke joy.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. And thus the ſoule is a joyfull habitation in the Divine Life, as if I ſhould liken it to a kindled Light, when the wicke of the Candle burneth, and caſteth a pleaſant light, [or ſhineth bright] and hath no paine in the ſhining, but a lightſome pleaſantneſſe, and yet the wicke continueth burning: yet you muſt underſtand, that there is in the burning wicke no paine or woe, but that there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a cauſe of the glance of life; for no <hi>fire</hi> is comparable to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> [fire].</p>
                     <p n="19">19. For, the Divine Nature, out of which the Divine fire of life burneth, is<note n="h" place="margin">Inſpired or infected.</note> filled with the <hi>Love of God,</hi> ſo that the light of God maketh another Principle in it ſelfe, wherein Nature is not<note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>perceived.</hi>
                        </note> felt, for it is the end of Nature: therefore the ſoule cannot comprehend in its own Eſſences, the light of God to poſſeſſe it. For the ſoule is a fire in the Eternall Nature, and doth not reach the end of Nature: for it continueth in Nature, as a creature created out of the Eternall Nature, which yet hath no comprehenſibility: but is a Spirit in a <hi>ſeaven-fold forme:</hi> Whereas yet in the Originality there is <hi>not ſeaven,</hi> but onely <hi>foure formes</hi> knowne, which uphold the Eternall Band, and thoſe [foure] are the ſource [or property] in the Anguiſh, wherein<note n="k" place="margin">That which is Eternall.</note> the Eternall conſiſteth: and thereout the <hi>other</hi> formes are wholly <hi>generated,</hi> wherein God and the Kingdome of Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and in the foure formes the Anguiſh and Torment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, if they are fingly alone, and therein we underſtand Hell-fire [to conſiſt,] and the Eternall wrath of God: and although we do not know the Originality of the Eſſence of God, yet we know the <hi>Eternall</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Geniture.</note> 
                        <hi>Birth</hi> which never had any beginning. And ſeeing it had no beginning, therefore it is the ſame this day, that ever it was from Eternity: and therefore we may well comprehend what we ſee and know this day, in the Light of God.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. None ought to account us ignorant, becauſe God hath given
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61125:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> us to know his own<note n="m" place="margin">Beeing or ſubſtance.</note> Eſſence, which we cannot nor muſt not deny, upon paine of the loſſe of the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> and of our eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for it is impoſſible for any man to have it, except it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him out of Grace in the Love of God: and when that is given to a Man, then that ſoule ſtandeth in the knowledge in the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God; which [ſoule] then ſpeaketh not of things ſtrange and afarre of, but of the things wherein it ſtandeth, and of it ſelfe: for it becometh ſeeing in the Light of God, ſo that it <hi>can know it ſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. Now that this can be, conſider, that the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of the ſoule ſtand in the <hi>Originall</hi> in the <hi>firſt Principle,</hi> and that the Divine Light ſhineth in it ſelfe, and maketh the <hi>ſecond Principle,</hi> and ſo there are two of <hi>them;</hi> and the ſoule ſeeth into the high knowledge of the light of the Second Principle, which ſhineth in it: why then ſhould it not ſpeake of its native Countrey wherein it liveth: and how wilt thou mad world (in the <hi>third Principle</hi> in the Spirit [or wiſdome] of the Starres and Elements) forbid that to it, whereas thou art blinde as to God, and lyeſt captivated in the Eternall Wrath, in the ſource [or property] of the Originall.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Now ſeeing it is ſo: we will therefore ſet downe the <hi>Ground of the Eternall Band,</hi> to be a looking Glaſſe for him that deſireth to ſee: though it be true indeed, that he cannot learne it of <hi>us,</hi> unleſſe he <hi>himſelfe</hi> enter into the New Birth <hi>into the life of Chriſt,</hi> that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light it ſelfe may ſhine in him, or elſe<note n="n" place="margin">That which is here written will be but as a Hiſtorie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome couched under it.</note> wee are but as a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to him, and ſhall not be underſtood by him.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. But when wee ſpeake of the ſource [or Originall] of the fire, and of its kindling (wee meane, concerning the Fire of Life) wee know for certaine, that in its Originall before the kindling of the fire, it conſiſts onely in two formes, and hath but one Mother, which is<note n="o" place="margin">Aſtringent or attractive.</note> harſh and draweth to her, and yet there is nothing in her ſelfe, but a willing of the Eternall Father in the Eternall Nature which he hath appointed in himſelfe to reveale, and to declare his <hi>wonders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. Now that Will is Eternall, and is not ſtirred up by any thing but by it ſelfe: and if that were not, all were nothing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darkneſſe nor light: therefore ſeeing there is ſomewhat, it muſt needs be the Eternall Will; and that is aſtringent and deſirous<note n="p" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> to Create the Wonders.</note> of the <hi>Wonders</hi> of the <hi>Creation.</hi> Therefore ſeeing there is a Deſire, the Deſire attracteth to it ſelfe, and that which is attracted in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire maketh the Will full, ſo that the Deſire is fulfilled: for the Will is as thinne [or empty] as<note n="q" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> a vacuum.</note> a Nothing, and that which is attracted into the Will maketh the Will thick [or groſſe and full] and that is its Darkneſſe: and the Eternall Deſire ſtandeth in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p n="25">
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61125:6"/>25. Now when the Will in the Deſire doth attract, that attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a ſting [<note n="r" place="margin">Pricking or ſpurring to Motion.</note> puncture or Goade] of the ſtirring; for the Will is thinne as a Nothing, and is quiet and ſtill, as [if it were] No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but the Will being an Eternall Deſiring, therefore it attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it ſelfe Eternally: and having nothing to attract, it attracteth <hi>it ſelfe,</hi> and impregnateth [or filleth] it ſelfe, and ſo the Nothing cometh to be a Darkneſſe, and the attracting<note n="ſ" place="margin">Is the ſpurre to the beginning of the beeing of a thing.</note> maketh the ſting of the firſt Eſſences, ſo that there is a ſtirring and <hi>originall of Mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. Now the Will cannot endure the attracting and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it would be free, and yet cannot, becauſe it is Deſirous; and ſeeing it cannot be free, it entreth with the attracting into it ſelfe, and taketh [or conceiveth] in it ſelfe <hi>another Will,</hi> which is, to goe out from the Darkneſſe into it ſelfe, and that other conceived Will is <hi>the Eternall Minde,</hi> and entreth into it ſelfe as a ſudden flaſh [of lightning] and <hi>diſſipateth</hi> the Darkneſſe, and goeth forth into it ſelfe, and dwelleth in it ſelfe, and maketh to it ſelfe <hi>another</hi> [or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) <hi>Principle</hi> of another Quality [ſource or condition], for the ſting of the ſtirring <hi>remaineth</hi> in the Darkneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Therefore now we ſhould ſpeake of the formes of the ſoure [or aſtringent] dark Nature. For wee underſtand that the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath a longing after the Light, which eternally<note n="t" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</note> ſtandeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, but in <hi>another Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="28">28. For, the two Formes, the ſoure and the bitter ſtinging, are the Originall of <hi>All</hi> things, and the Eternall Will is the Mother [or Matrix] wherein they are Generated: and Wee are to know that the<note n="u" place="margin">Aſtringency or attracting.</note> ſoureneſſe alwayes attracteth with the conception of the Will, and that <hi>attracting</hi> is the ſtinging of the ſtirring, which the<note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>harſhneſs.</hi>
                        </note> ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot well endure: for the attracting ſoureneſſe deſireth the ſoure ſtrong <hi>ſhutting up</hi> in Death, and the ſtinging bitterneſſe is the <hi>Opener,</hi> and yet it were a nothing in it ſelfe without the Will.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Now when the ſoureneſſe attracteth ſo ſtrongly, it <hi>cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi> the ſtinging, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoureneſſes own attracting; but ſtirreth much more, and the ſoureneſſes may not endure the ſtirring nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it deſireth the ſtill <hi>Death.</hi> And thus it is a Chaine and Band, which ever maketh it ſelfe, and hath <hi>no [other] Maker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="30">30. Now theſe entring into one another, ſo ſwiftly, like a ſudden thought, the ſting would faine <hi>get out</hi> from the ſoureneſſe but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; for the ſoureneſſe generateth and maintaineth it: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to get the upper hand, [or get looſe] it <hi>turneth round</hi> like a wheele, and ſo breaketh aſunder the attracted ſoureneſſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a continuall<note n="y" place="margin">

                        <hi>Originall</hi> of the Spirit or Eternall Nature, in the Eternall Will.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. For the ſoure deſiring, attracteth and maketh penetration, and the bitterneſſe breaketh it aſunder in the turning wheele, and ſo there ariſeth <hi>multiplicity</hi> of Eſſences, and it is as it were a furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or as I may ſay in a ſimilitude, a <hi>Confuſion</hi> of the Eternall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a cauſe of the Eſſences: and this the Eternall Will muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer [to be] in it ſelfe, and <hi>therefore</hi> it conceiveth or taketh to it ſelfe <hi>another Will,</hi> to flie out from this wheele, and yet cannot doe it, for it is its own ſubſtance; and ſeeing it cannot, and yet cannot leave its eternall deſire and longing, it holdeth and attracteth to it ſelfe; ſo that the Eſſences are continually generated, and yet (without the deſiring) they are nothing; and thus the whole forme ſtandeth in the<note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſound.</hi>
                        </note> noiſe, and is called <hi>MAR:</hi> and ſeeing the Will cannot be free, it falleth into a great <hi>anguiſh,</hi> to ſpeake according to Mans underſtanding, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may comprehend the ſenſe and depth of it.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. For the Will is the conception, and that which is conceived in the Will is its Darkneſſe, and the deſiring is the Eſſence, and the contrary will is the wheele of the multiplicity of Eſſences, ſo that they are numberleſſe, but the multitude is according to the <hi>Mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> Theſe two formes are the Eternall Eſſences, and <hi>the Eternall Band,</hi> which maketh it ſelfe, and cannot doe otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. For the vaſt infinite ſpace, deſireth narrowneſſe and inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure [or comprehenſion] wherein it may manifeſt it ſelfe, for elſe in the wide ſtillneſſe, there would be no manifeſtation: therefore there muſt be an <hi>attraction</hi> and incloſing, out of which the <hi>manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> appeareth: and therefore alſo, there muſt be a contrary Will; for a tranſparent and quiet will, is as nothing, and generateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but if a Will muſt Generate, then it muſt be in <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> wherein it may forme, and may generate in that thing: for nothing, is nothing but a <hi>ſtillneſſe</hi> without any ſtirring; where there is neither darkneſſe nor light, neither life nor death.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Now ſince wee cleerly perceive, that <hi>there is</hi> both light and darkneſſe, and moreover an eternall ſtirring and forming, which is <hi>not onely</hi> in the place of this world as farre as our ſenſes reach, but without end and number, where the Angelicall world ſhineth cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet not in the incloſure of the Darkneſſe; therefore wee ſhould raiſe our<note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſenſes.</hi>

                     <p n="35">35. Now if it ſhine out of the <hi>Genetrix</hi> [or <hi>Matrix</hi>], then it muſt come forth out of the <hi>Genetrix.</hi> For the <hi>Genetrix</hi> is a Darkneſſe, and yet that were nothing neither, if <hi>the Eternall Word</hi> (which

                     <p n="37">37. Thou ſayeſt, God hath <hi>created</hi> it; very well: but why art thou blinde, and doſt not acknowledge it, whereas thou art ind d <hi>the ſimilitude of God?</hi> Why ſpeakeſt thou <hi>more</hi> of God then thou knoweſt and is <hi>revealed</hi> or manifeſted to thee?

                     <p n="38">38. Seeing then, God is the Word which hath made all things, he muſt therefore be <hi>in all things:</hi> for a Spirit is <hi>not</hi> a made thing but a generated thing in it ſelfe, which hath the <hi>Centre</hi> of its Birth in it ſelfe, or elſe it would be corruptible: therefore now the <hi>Centre</hi> muſt ſtand in the Eternall Maker, or elſe it were <hi>tranſitorie:</hi> for there is nothing from Eternity but the Word, and the Word was God: and therefore it muſt needs be its <hi>own Eternall Maker</hi> of it ſelfe; and it ſelfe muſt expreſſe it ſelfe as a Word out of it ſelfe, as out of its own Maker.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. For where there is a Word, there alſo is a ſpeaker to ſpeake it. Now ſince it is the Father that ſpeaketh it, and the Word which is ſpoken out of the Centre of the Father is the Sonne thereof: and ſeeing the Father in his Centre calleth himſelfe a Conſuming Fire, and yet the Sonne (the Word) is a Light of Love, humility, meekneſſe, purity, and holineſſe, and that the Father of the Word is ſo alſo called and acknowledged <hi>throughout the holy Scripture,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhould conſider the<note n="f" place="margin">Quality, or property.</note> ſource of the Fire in the Centre of the Father, ſeeing <hi>the Father and the Word is one,</hi> and yet <hi>in two [di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct] formes:</hi> and that alſo the Wrath and the Anger, together with the Abyſſe of Hell ſtandeth in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Father.</p>

                        <hi>Generation.</hi> The Word in the Father, and the Spirit which goeth forth from the Power, is the Life of the Deity.</p>

                     <p n="9">9 For as is mentioned before; The Eternall Word (<hi>viz.</hi> the Eternall <hi>Will</hi> of the Father) is the Creator of all things, and the Eternall Father, is the <hi>Beeing</hi> of the Will, out of which the Word hath created all things. Now the Eſſences are the beeing which <hi>cauſeth</hi> the Will: for heere you muſt underſtand, that there are two Wills in one Beeing, and they cauſe <hi>two Principles:</hi> One is the Love and the other is the Anger or the Source [or property] of Wrath. The <hi>firſt</hi> Will is not called God, but Nature: the <hi>ſecond</hi> Will is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led A and O, the beginning and the End from Eternity to Eternity: and in the firſt Will, Nature could not be manifeſt, the ſecond Will [it is, that] maketh Nature manifeſt, for the ſecond Will is the vertue in the ſtrength, and the one would be <hi>nothing</hi> without the other.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Seeing then, that the Will of the Father in the Eternity, is the firſt, therefore alſo he is the <hi>firſt</hi> Perſon in the Ternary, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Centre</hi> it ſelfe. So now the Will or the Centre is, to deſire to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Word or Heart: for it is nothing elſe, and it can be called nothing elſe, but the <hi>deſiring</hi> in the Will.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Thus we ſearch in a deep ſence in the Minde: and do finde, that the deſiring is eagar and <hi>attractive:</hi> for it is the ſtrong might: not in one point onely, but every where all over, contracting the wideneſſe into narrowneſſe, to manifeſt it ſelfe [therein]. For elſe there would be nothing in the whole Deepe, and there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare nothing, but all would be ſtill and quiet.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But now the deſiring <hi>attracteth,</hi> and yet it hath nothing there but it ſelfe: and that which is attracted is the impregnation of the deſiring, and maketh the deſire <hi>full,</hi> and yet is nothing but a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for that which is attracted is thicker then the will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the darkneſſe of the thin Will.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. For the will is as thin [or empty] as [if it were] <hi>nothing,</hi> and very ſtill and quiet: but the deſiring maketh it <hi>full,</hi> and the going forth in the deſiring is the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> viz. a ſting of ſenſibility, (which is againſt the ſenſibility) which the deſiring alſo cannot endure, but attracteth the more vehemently to it, and ſo the ſting or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is the greater, and rageth <hi>againſt</hi> the attracting, and yet cannot get out of it, for the deſiring <hi>generateth</hi> it, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it, for it is ſuch an Enmity as [is between] heate and cold.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61125:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>14. And ſo the deſiring, which in it ſelfe is an earneſt longing, by its longing doth <hi>awaken</hi> ſuch a raging (which doth ſo ſting in that will) that the longing becometh very ſoure and ſtrongly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, that it might <hi>hold</hi> the ſting faſt, whereby the ſting as a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, affordeth mobility, in which the longing attaineth the firſt crack [or ſhreek] of trembling, from whence ariſeth a contrarious <hi>Anguiſh:</hi> for in the Anguiſh of the longing (in the hard attracting) is cauſed a <hi>ſharp coldneſſe:</hi> and the attraction is eager, bitter and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that it affordeth a terrible ſtrong <hi>Power,</hi> which the ſting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure, but would faine breake away, and yet it cannot: For its own <hi>Mother</hi> that generateth it, holdeth it, and ſo being it cannot get away upwards, it runneth round like a <hi>wheele,</hi> and breaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the contraction, from whence the Eſſences of multiplicity doe ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. And this is the <hi>right Centre:</hi> for in the wheele doth exiſt the nature of Mobility and of the Eſſences: and it is a <hi>Band</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though without<note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>perception.</hi>
                        </note> feeling or underſtanding: but in this Forme it is onely called, the Centre: for it is the Circle of life, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring hath ſhut up, out of the ſtill wideneſſe, into narrowneſſe: although it is not comprehenſible, but every where <hi>meerly ſpirit and forme of Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. Seeing then that the Raver maketh ſuch a ſtinging bitter wheele (in the ſharp cold) therefore the Centre is ſo <hi>terrible</hi> like a great Anguiſh, where the life is continually broken, [or <hi>deſtroyed</hi>] and by the Eſſences is alſo <hi>built</hi> [againe] in ſuch a manner, and is like to Life and Death.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> and high<note n="g" place="margin">Naturaliſts.</note> knowers of <hi>Nature,</hi> write, that Nature conſiſteth in three things, <hi>viz.</hi> in<note n="h" place="margin">🜍 ☿ 🜔</note> 
                        <hi>Sulphur, Mercurie,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> which is very right: but the ſimple will underſtand nothing therein: and although the apprehenſion of it was open to the <hi>wiſe</hi> [ſo that they <hi>underſtood</hi> it] yet at this preſent time, <hi>very few</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Centre,</hi> but they have it in the Hiſtorie, as alſo [they have] the <hi>Divinity</hi> or Theologie from the mouth of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which at preſent is alſo no other then a <hi>Hiſtorie,</hi> without the power and the living Spirit, (which was among the Apoſtles) as is cleerly teſtified by their contentious diſputations, lip-labour and <hi>dead Letter</hi> [in their Teachings].</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Now ſeeing wee have through the Divine Grace attained the <hi>Light,</hi> and are able to know the Centre, which <hi>is the Birth of our life:</hi> wee have power to demonſtrate it, and ſhew what is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and underſtood in the three words, <hi>Sulphur, Mercurie,</hi> and <hi>Salt:</hi> not that we thereby deſpiſe the ignorant blindneſſe: but as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wee would willingly afford and ſhew <hi>them</hi> the Light. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our ſpeech ſeemeth ſimple, yet out knowledge, meaning,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61125:11"/> and apprehenſion is very <hi>Deepe:</hi> none ſhould be offended at the ſimple ſpeech: as if wee had <hi>not</hi> the deepe apprehenſion. Let him but reade it with a true earneſtneſſe, and conſider ſeriouſly of it, <hi>in the feare of God,</hi> and he <hi>ſhall</hi> finde well enough what Spirits childe wee are, in this writing, but wee would have him faithfully warned, concerning the ſcorners and hypocrites.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. As is mentioned concerning the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the Centre is and may very well be called <hi>PH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R:</hi> but if the Light be generated, the light that ſhineth out of the <hi>PH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> is called <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> for it is the <hi>ſoule</hi> thereof. And as I ſay of the dark Centre, wherein the Divine Light is generated, the ſame I ſay alſo of Nature: though indeed they are one: but wee muſt ſo ſpeake: that wee might bring it into the thoughts of the Reader, that he might <hi>incline</hi> his minde to the Light, and <hi>ſo attaine it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. For the <hi>two</hi> Formes: <hi>viz.</hi> ſharp cold: and bitter ſtinging, which are generated by the longing in the Eternall Will; they <hi>hold</hi> the Centre, and make the wheele of the Eſſences, whence the<note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
                        </note> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as alſo perception and mobility continually ariſe Eternally.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Now theſe two formes are in very great and terrible angu ſh, in themſelves, <hi>without</hi> the other formes that are generated out of them. For the attracting ſharp ſoureneſſe is like to <hi>hard</hi> ſtones, and the ſting of the attracting is the breaker of the aſtringency: and ſo it is like a wheele, and may well be called <hi>PH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R:</hi> the Language of Nature in that ſyllable <hi>doth declare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. Therefore though the two formes enter ſo terribly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the <hi>Will,</hi> and hold the Will in the darkneſſe, yet the will cannot be <hi>captivated,</hi> for its own propriety is to be <hi>meeke</hi> and quiet, and that propriety it <hi>cannot</hi> looſe in the two Formes, for it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; and yet it muſt be <hi>in</hi> the two Formes, and dwelleth in the ſting, and is the flaſh thereof: for the two Formes are darke in themſelves, but the Will is not [ſo], for it is free in it ſelfe: but the two Formes take it into their property: for it is their <hi>Father,</hi> and it ſharpeneth it ſelfe in their properties, ſo that it ſhineth as a flaſh [of lightning].</p>
                     <p n="23">23. For the ſoure aſtringency maketh <hi>dark;</hi> and the bitter ſting (in the wheele) <hi>diſſipateth</hi> the Darkneſſe: and ſo the liberty of the ſtill will <hi>ſhineth</hi> in the wheele in the whirring as a flaſh [of lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing]: for the will ſo ſharpeneth it ſelfe from the ſoure aſtringency, that it becometh very <hi>ſtrong,</hi> for it is as when ſteele and a ſtone are knocked one againſt another to ſtrike <hi>fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. For there is underſtood to be in the Fire, <hi>two things;</hi> viz. the liberty<note n="k" place="margin">Extra natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> without Nature, and the ſoure ſtrongneſſe of Nature; as you have an Example in a <hi>ſtone,</hi> out of which you ſtrike Fire. For when you ſtrike upon the <hi>ſharp</hi> of the ſtone, the bitter ſting of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61125:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſharpeneth it ſelfe, and is<note n="l" place="margin">Vexed or angred.</note> ſtirred in the higheſt <hi>Degree.</hi> For Nature is diſſipated or<note n="m" place="margin">Shivered to pieces.</note> broken aſunder in the <hi>ſharpneſſe,</hi> ſo that the liberty ſhineth as a flaſh [of lightning]: and that you may heere ſee to be true: for as ſoone as the liberty <hi>ſhineth,</hi> it conſumeth the Darkneſſe, and thence it cometh, that the <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>is a conſuming Fire.</hi> For as ſoone as the flaſh in the ſharpneſſe ſeizeth on any thing that is eſſentiall, it <hi>conſumeth</hi> it inſtantly, ſo that there is <hi>no</hi> nature more left.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. And the cauſe of the flaſh going out ſo <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> is that the ſharpneſſe cannot retaine it: for the flaſh is <hi>free</hi> from Nature, and is onely ſeene in the breaking.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. And wee give you to underſtand, that this <hi>liberty</hi> without the Nature, is God the <hi>Father:</hi> and the Nature is thus generated in him, ſo that he is <hi>Omnipotent</hi> over Nature, even as the minde of Man is above the ſenſes; for it hath all one Originall, as wee will ſhew you hereafter following.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Further concerning the <hi>Birth of Nature,</hi> wee give you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this by way of ſimilitude: When the flaſh ſhineth thus in the ſoure anguiſh, then there is a very great crack, which the ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe captivateth, and terrifieth much more, for its dark propriety in the ſoure Death is <hi>killed</hi> in a moment, ſo that it looſeth its ſoure propriety and ſinketh back, and can no more attract ſo ſtrongly; and then the flaſh goeth directly through the <hi>ſting</hi> of the raging of the whirring wheele: where the ſting muſt ſpread forth on each ſide, and the flaſh goeth through the <hi>midſt;</hi> and ſo the wheele cometh to be a Croſſe, and can no more whirle about, but ſtandeth ſhivering in the ſharp Might of the Will of the Eternall Liberty, <hi>which is God the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="28">28. And now when the ſtrong ſoureneſſe hath captivated the flaſh of the Liberty, that it looſeth its propriety; then the <hi>fourth</hi> forme (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Salt-Spirit</hi>) is generated: for the ſterne harſhneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh pliant from the fire and the crack; and yet retaineth the ſharpneſſe: and ſo this forme is like a ſharp <hi>Water-Spirit:</hi> and the flaſh (<hi>viz.</hi> the crack) is the <hi>third</hi> forme, and maketh in it ſelfe in the ſoure killed-anguiſh, a <hi>Brimſtone-Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. For if the ſterne ſoureneſſe looſeth its firſt dry propriety, it muſt be ſoft, and yet it cannot, for it is <hi>terribly</hi> ſharp: and heere is the<note n="n" place="margin">Mark, Butt, Goale, or limit.</note> 
                        <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Eternall Death:</hi> for the deſire out of the free will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attract ſo any more: for it ſtandeth in the anguiſh of the Crack, and yet retaineth its propriety in the attracting.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. For every anguiſh hath a deſire to goe forth from the ſource [or paine]: and it is the naturall right of the anguiſh to <hi>expell</hi> from it ſelfe, and yet it cannot, but the paine is thereby more ſtirred and greater: as may be underſtood in a raging ſwelling ſore, where the

                        </note> Eſſences laboureth to be <hi>ridde</hi> of the paine, and by the labouring of the Eſſences the ſore becometh bigger, and the ſource (in the <hi>Brimſtone-Spirit</hi>) is ſwelled up: and the more the<note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>humours.</hi>
                        </note> Eſſences ſtrive, the <hi>greater</hi> is the wheele of the Anguiſh.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Thus I propoſe <hi>Nature</hi> to you, to be conſidered of, which if you conſider it <hi>well, cannot</hi> be ſpoken againſt: for it appeareth in all things, and it hath its Birth juſt ſo. And Nature ſtandeth thus in <hi>foure Formes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in a ſoure and ſtrong attracting, which is called<note n="p" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> ſoureneſſe, tartneſſe, or aſtringency.</note>

                     <p n="33">33. And then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the attracting is its<note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſpurre.</hi>
                        </note> ſting, which rageth in the ſoureneſſe, and breaketh the hardneſſe, and maketh the wheele of the innumerable Eſſences, wherein the <hi>Wonders</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. But the flaſh of the Liberty of the Eternall Will, which ſharpeneth it ſelfe in the ſoureneſſe, and turneth to <hi>conſuming Fire,</hi> breaketh its wheele, wherein as a flaſh it penetrateth through in a moment, and terrifieth its Mother, the ſoureneſſe, which looſeth her hard propriety, and is changed into a ſharp nature like <hi>Salt;</hi> and in this ſharpneſſe, the ſting alſo looſeth its own right and becometh bitter: for it hath in it <hi>two</hi> Formes, <hi>viz.</hi> the raging, and alſo the flaſh of the Fire, which are like Brimſtone, and it is the might of the <hi>kindling</hi> of the Fire, for the ſource [or property] of the Fire ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therein.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. Underſtand us right thus: the flaſh of fire out of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe maketh the <hi>third</hi> forme in Nature: for it maketh in the ſoureneſſe, and out of the Rager (the bitter ſting in the tart anguiſh) a Brimſtone Spirit, wherein the <hi>flaſh</hi> ſtandeth, and is the ſoule (or the Eternall Life) of the <hi>foure</hi> Formes. For the anguiſh maketh in it ſelfe <hi>againe</hi> a deſire to flie out from the anguiſh, and yet there is <hi>nothing</hi> that can flie away, but ſo it is in the <hi>Centre,</hi> and is called the Centre no more.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. The <hi>fourth</hi> Forme is the changing of the hard ſoureneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Crack of the flaſh: The dark hardneſſe perceiving that it is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as [it were] dead and overcome, and is then turned into <hi>SAL:</hi> and yet retaineth the propriety of the ſoure attracting.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Thus the foure Formes of Nature, are no more called the <hi>Centre,</hi> though indeed they have the Centre in them, and in their Originall, but [are called] <hi>Sulphur, Mercurius,</hi> and <hi>Sal.</hi> For the Brimſtone-Spirit is the <hi>Soule</hi> of the foure Formes: for it hath the fire in it, and the anguiſh in it maketh <hi>another</hi> Will ſo that the foure Formes have an Eternall will in them which is their <hi>own:</hi> for that will is to flie aloft out of the foure Formes, <hi>above</hi> Nature, and to<note n="r" place="margin">Kindle the Fire in Nature.</note> kindle Nature in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and ſo to be in a horrible might, as may

                     <p n="38">38. Thus underſtand us rightly, what the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi>
                        </note> Wiſemen of old have underſtood by the three words, <hi>Sulphur, Mercurius,</hi> and <hi>Sal:</hi> though they all could not apprehend the high Light; yet they underſtood it well enough in the light of this world, <hi>viz</hi> in the third Principle, all which ha h one and the ſame underſtanding and meaning; only they <hi>underſtood not</hi> the three Principles: or elſe they <hi>had known</hi> God; and ſo they remained in the light of this world as Heathens with their underſtanding. For they have found the <hi>ſoule</hi> of the foure Formes in the light of the vertue of the Sun [only], and the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle</hi> was no further revealed to them.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. There the ſoule ſtandeth in the Eternall Band, and there, in the Croſſe of Nature, out of the Originall Eternall Will, is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Word</hi> Generated, which is the Maker and Creator in Nature, and this hath been hidden to them, even to this very day: but the Time diſcovereth it, where it ſtandeth as a<note n="t" place="margin">To be ſeene.</note> Banner: of which [ſhall be ſpoken] in its place.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. And deepe conſiderate Reaſon hath very cleerly in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, what <hi>Sulphur, Mercurius,</hi> and <hi>Sal</hi> are: for <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> is the ſoule, and is a Brimſtone-Spirit, which hath the flaſh of fire with all Formes in it: but if the power and light of the Sunne doe operate therein (ſeeing the ſoule ſtandeth in fleſh and bloud) the Sunne with its friendly beames, maketh out of the ſoure Salt-Spirit, <hi>an Oyle,</hi> and kindleth the Fire: and ſo the Brimſtone-Spirit burneth, and is a <hi>Light</hi> in the Eſſences: and out of the anxious Will cometh the Minde: and out of the wheele of the Eſſences come the thoughts: for the vertue of the Sunne hath alſo the Minde, ſo that it doth not ſtand in the Anguiſh, but rejoyceth in the vertue of the Light.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Thus <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> is the ſoule: in an hearb it is the Oyle, and in Man alſo, according to the Spirit of <hi>this</hi> world in the third Principle, which is <hi>continually</hi> generated out of the anguiſh of the Will in the Minde, and the Brimſtone-Worme is the Spirit, which hath the Fire and <hi>burneth: PH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> is the ſoure wheele in it ſelfe which cauſeth that.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. <hi>Mercurius</hi> comprehendeth all the foure Formes, even as the life ſpringeth up, and yet hath not its beginning in the Centre as the <hi>PH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> hath, but after the flaſh of fire, when the ſoure dark forme is terrified, where the hardneſſe is turned into pliant ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and where the ſecond will (<hi>viz.</hi> the will of Nature, which is called the Anguiſh) ariſeth, there <hi>Mercurius</hi> hath its Originall. For <hi>MER</hi> is the ſhivering wheele, very horrible, ſharp, veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and hoſtile; which aſſimulate it thus in the ſoureneſſe in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61125:13"/> flaſh of fire, where the ſoure wrathfull life <hi>ariſeth.</hi> The ſyllable <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        </hi> is the preſſing out, of the <hi>Anxious</hi> will of the Minde, from Nature: which is climing up, and <hi>willeth</hi> to be out aloft. <hi>R I,</hi> is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the flaſh of Fire, which in <hi>MER</hi> giveth a <hi>cleere</hi> Sound and Tune. For the flaſh maketh the tune, and it is the Salt-Spirit which<note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>knocketh.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>ſoundeth,</hi> and its forme [or quality] is gritty like ſand, and herein ariſe noiſes, ſounds, and voyces, and thus <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        </hi> comprehendeth the flaſh, and ſo the preſſure is as a <hi>Winde</hi> that thruſteth upwards, and giveth a Spirit to the flaſh, ſo that it liveth and <hi>burneth.</hi> Thus the ſyllable <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> is called the burning Fire, which with the Spirit <hi>continually</hi> driveth it ſelfe forth: and the ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        </hi> preſſeth continually upon the flaſh.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. And the third word <hi>SAL</hi> is the Salt-Spirit; becauſe the auntient<note n="x" place="margin">Philoſophers.</note> Wiſemen ſaw, how Nature is thus divided into many parts, and that every Forme of Nature hath a parricular Matter in this world, may be ſeene in the Earth: and that the Salt-Spirit eſpecially is the <hi>greateſt</hi> in corporeall<note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſubſtances.</hi>
                        </note> things, (for it preſerveth the Body that it doth not decay) therefore they have rightly ſet downe this Gate onely; which is the Mother of Nature. For out of <hi>this forme,</hi> in the Creation, Earth, ſtones, water, and all ſorts of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, were made, yet With the <hi>mixture</hi> of the other Formes; as you ſhall ſee hereafter: My beloved Reader, underſtand us thus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own ſenſe, meaning, and apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. The <hi>foure</hi> Formes in <hi>themſelves</hi> are the Anger and the Wrath of God in the Eternall Nature: and they are in themſelves nothing elſe but ſuch a ſource [or property] as ſtandeth in the Darkneſſe, and is not materiall, but an Originality of the Spirit, without which there would be nothing.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. For, the foure Formes are the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all things, as you may perceive, that every life hath poyſon, yea the poyſon it ſelfe is the life: and therefore many creatures are ſo venomous, becauſe they <hi>proceed</hi> from a poyſonous Originall. And you muſt know, (though <hi>theſe</hi> be the <hi>chiefe</hi> cauſes of Nature) that Nature conſiſteth in very <hi>many</hi> more other Formes: for this maketh the wheele of the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which maketh innumerable Eſſences: where every Eſſence is againe a Centre: ſo that a whole Birth of <hi>cleane another</hi> Forme may appeare.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. <hi>Therefore</hi> the Power of God is unſearchable: and our writing is not to that end, that wee ſhould ſearch out the ground of the Deity in the Eternall Nature [and lay it before any]: no, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be: but wee will <hi>direct</hi> the blinde the way that himſelfe muſt goe: wee cannot goe with <hi>his feete,</hi> but (as a Chriſtian) we would faine lead him, and impart to him what we have; not out of boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelves, but that wee might helpe to plant the great body
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61125:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
[conſiſting] of the Members in Chriſt; of which wee will make mention hereafter: to which <hi>end</hi> theſe very high things are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that wee might ſhew you the right marke in the Originall: that <hi>your ſelfe</hi> might ſee, and learne to underſtand the courſe of the world, and how blinde <hi>all</hi> are concerning God, and what the cauſe and end of<note n="z" place="margin">The blindneſſe of the world.</note> it is.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. Wee tell you this, that you might rightly conſider it; for, theſe <hi>foure Formes</hi> are in all things: yet in this world (as in the third Principle) they are not underſtood [to be] in their<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt effect.</note> very eager Eſſences. For the <hi>vertue</hi> of the Sunne, in the Elements <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth</hi> all things, ſo that the Eſſences ſtand not in ſuch a wrathfull ſource [or property]; but are as a pleaſant friendly life: as the <hi>Light</hi> out of the ſecond Principle, (which is the Light out of the Word &amp; Heart of God the Father) doth enlighten the <hi>foure Formes in the Centre</hi> of the Angelicall Spirits, ſo that they are in their own Centre, friendly, lovely, and very pleaſant.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. And you ſhould well conſider <hi>the Fall of the Devills,</hi> who have loſt the Light of the Heart of God, and muſt now ſtand in the foure Formes of the <hi>Originall,</hi> in ſuch an anxious ſource [or condition] as was above mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. Thus is the ſoule of Man alſo <hi>together</hi> out of this Eternall Band breathed into Man, and <hi>enlightened</hi> from the light of God: but in the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> it is gone out from the Eternall Light of the Heart of God, into the light of <hi>this</hi> world: and it hath now to expect (if it have not entered againe into the light of God, when the light of this world doth breake off from it) that it muſt then remaine in the foure Formes (without the light) in the firſt <hi>Birth</hi> of the life, with the Devills.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. For the foure Formes (without the Eternall Light) are the Abyſſe, the Anger of God, the Hell, and the horrible flaſh of fire in the wheele of<note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>breaking.</hi>
                        </note> Corruption in the flying up of <hi>Mercurie</hi> [or the terrible cracking noyſe]. <hi>Their light</hi> is in the Brimſtone-Spirit, which they muſt awaken in themſelves: <hi>or elſe</hi> their Spirit ſtandeth in Eternall Darkneſſe, &amp; its <hi>living Forme</hi> of the Abyſſe is a Dominion of a ſevere [eager property or] ſource, which climeth up in the flaſh of Fire [willing to be] above God and the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet cannot reach, nor feele nor ſee them: for<note n="c" place="margin">The Eternall Darkneſſe.</note> it is a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> which comprehendeth neither this world nor the Angelicall world: and yet is <hi>not ſevered,</hi> [but is] in [one and the ſame] Place.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. For wee offer to your conſideration: that as wee Men with our [Earthly] eyes which wee have from this world, cannot ſee God and the Angells: which yet are every moment preſent to us, yes the <hi>Deity it ſelfe</hi> is in us, and yet wee are not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61125:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> it, except wee<note n="d" place="margin">Set all our thoughts and reſolutions upon God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> put our imagination and earneſt will into God, and then God appeareth to us in the Will, and <hi>filleth</hi> the Minde; where wee feele God and ſee him with our eyes, [<hi>viz.</hi> the eyes of our Minde.]</p>
                     <p n="52">52. So alſo if wee put our imagination and will into evill [and wickedneſſe<note n="d" place="margin">Set all our thoughts and reſolutions upon God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note>, then we receive the ſource of Hell in the Wrath: and the Devill layeth <hi>faſt hold</hi> on our very Heart in the Anger of God, yet wee ſee him not with theſe eyes, onely the <hi>Minde</hi> and poore ſoule in the Eternall ſource of the Originall, underſtand it and tremble at the Wrath: ſo that many a ſoule deſpaireth, and caſteth it ſelfe into the ſource of the Originall, and driveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to death, by ſword, the rope, or the water, that it may <hi>thereby ſuddenly</hi> be ridde of the torment, or ſource, in this life, which is from the Third Principle. For that ſoule ſtandeth <hi>between</hi> the Kingdome of Heaven and the Kingdome of this world, in ſcorne, and <hi>therefore</hi> maketh haſt to the Abyſſe.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Alſo wee give you very <hi>earneſtly</hi> to conſider: that God did <hi>not</hi> create a peculiar Hell and place of Torment, on purpoſe to plague the Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> Angells and Men; becauſe <hi>he is a God that willeth not Evill,</hi> and doth himſelfe forbid it: and hath therefore ſuffered his Heart to become Man, that he might redeeme Man out of the Eternall anguiſhing ſource [or torment] of the Abyſſe, which endureth <hi>for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="54">54. And therefore as ſoone as the Devills went away from the light of God, and would domineere in the Might of the Fire, over the Meekneſſe of the Heart of God, they were immediatly <hi>in the ſame</hi> houre and <hi>moment</hi> in the Abyſſe of Hell, and were held by it: for there was no peculiar ſource [or place of Torment] made for them: but they remained without God, in the foure Formes of the Eternall Nature.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. So alſo it is with the ſoules of Men, if they doe not attaine the Light of God; which yet with great longing ſtandeth before the ſoule, and it is hidden in the very <hi>ground</hi> of the ſoule. And the ſoule is to doe no more, but put its will, (as a ſprout out of the foure Formes) againe into the Light of God, where then it is <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated anew in the Will,</hi> and in the Life of God.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Wee give the Courteous Reader to underſtand: that the [Helliſh] creatures, which are the Devills and the damned ſoules, have <hi>not onely</hi> foure Formes in the Band of their life; but their Formes are infinite, like the thoughts of Men: and they <hi>can</hi> turne themſelves into the Formes of all Creatures: but there are onely foure Formes <hi>manifeſt</hi> to them, as alſo in the Abyſſe of Hell: but they may bring forth <hi>every</hi> forme out of the <hi>Matrix, except</hi> the light, the Fire is their right life, and the ſoure aſtringency of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is their right food.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61125:14"/>57. For one Eſſence nouriſheth the other, ſo that it is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Band: and ſo the Devills and damned ſoules are onely living Spirits in the<note n="e" place="margin">

                     <p n="58">58.

And this other generated will in the firſt will, is the <hi>Heart</hi> of the firſt will, and is in the firſt will as a <hi>Word,</hi> which moveth in it ſelfe, and remaineth Eternally in the Birth of the firſt will; for it is his Sonne or Heart: and is ſevered [or diſtinct:] from the firſt will in that it hath a <hi>ſeverall Centre in it ſelfe.</hi>

But becauſe it may happen that wee ſhould be as one that is dumb to you, and hard to be underſtood, in this deſcription, (for the underſtanding and apprehenſion of it is not in the <hi>ſubtile</hi> ſpirit of this outward world;) wee will therefore ſhew how <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Three Heavenly Formes are Generated</hi> [being together with the ſoure fore-mentioned formes, the ſeaven formes or Spirits of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture] in which [three formes] eſpecially, God, the Kingdome of Heaven, Paradiſe, and the Angelicall world is underſtood; to try whether it might be brought into the minde of the Reader.</p>

For the Divine Minde in the Heart of God, that is onely totall [or perfect] but elſe there is nothing totall, for without that, all ſtand in the Eſſences, and God onely is <hi>Free,</hi> and nothing elſe: and therefore wee ſpeake but in part, and comprehend the totall in the <hi>Minde:</hi> for wee have no tongue to expreſſe it: wee only bring the Reader to a<note n="i" place="margin">Which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to heaven.</note> Ladder, [he muſt goe up himſelfe.]</p>
                     <p n="68">68. If wee will <hi>rightly</hi> ſpeake or write of God, wee muſt ſpeake of the Light, and of the flame of Love: for therein is God rightly underſtood.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Wee cannot ſay, that the ſource of the fire is Light, we ſee it onely <hi>ſhine</hi> out of the Fire. Thus now wee have informed you concerning the Originall of the Fire, how it is generated in the wheele of the Eſſences, in the hard anxious ſharpneſſe, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its ſhining out of the Eternall Libertie, where the libertie is driven on in Nature, ſo that the libertie becometh a ſource [or propettie], <hi>which is Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="70">70. So alſo wee have mentioned, how the flaſh inſtantly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the wheele of the Eſſences, and maketh a Croſſe, and then the wheele of the Eſſences turneth round <hi>no more;</hi> but ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wavering in the ſound [of the crack], and all Eſſences receive their vertue and ſtrength in the flaſh of the Croſſe: for the flaſh preſſeth right through, and divideth the Eſſences of the wheele: and the Eſſences preſſe through<note n="k" place="margin">Squarely, Croſſewiſe on each ſide.</note> flatly upon the flaſh: for the flaſh is their Spirit, which in the ſoure aſtringency maketh a Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtony Forme.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Thus the <hi>birth</hi> ſtandeth ſquare like a Croſſe, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, the Centre of the Birth, which driveth up the flaſh aloft, and ſo the whole Birth is as a ſprout, where the <hi>fire</hi> driveth up, and the <hi>Eſſences</hi> haſten after the fire-Spirit, as their own ſpirit, which attracteth and deſireth them, for they are its food and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is their life, and one is <hi>not</hi> without the other.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Now underſtand us concerning the Crack of the Fire, for it is horrible and conſuming, and overcometh all the Formes of all the Eſſences: for as ſoone as the <hi>twinckling</hi> beginneth, all the formes of the Darkneſſe are conſumed, and the dark ſoure aſtringency (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſterne Death) trembleth at the life, and falleth back as dead and overcome, and of hard becometh feeble and weake; and ſo becometh heavy, as being impotent and not<note n="l" place="margin">Not able to ſubſiſt.</note> fix in it ſelfe; and <hi>thence</hi> cometh weight in Nature. For the ſoure aſtringent <hi>Matrix</hi> becometh thin and light; and a Water-Spirit, from whence the Water is Generated.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. And now this Crack of the ſoure aſtringency in the Dark Death, is a Crack of <hi>Great Joy,</hi> for of dark it becometh light: and or when the flaſh twinckleth in the ſoure aſtringency of the ſting,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61125:16"/> the ſting is terrified much more then its mother the ſoure aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and yet it is no hoſtile crack or terrifying; but a very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full crack or terrour of exulting, that its <hi>mother</hi> is ſo thin, pliant, and ſoft, whereby the ſting <hi>looſeth</hi> its fiery propriety, and in the Liberty of the Eternall Will (in the Centre) becometh white, cleere, light, amiable, and joyfull; and herewith ſpringeth up <hi>the fift forme of Nature,</hi> viz. the friendly <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="74">74. For there the flaſh deſireth with great longing to have its <hi>mother</hi> for its food, and here is the true originall of <hi>Life;</hi> for it is the kindling of the Light in the ſoure aſtringent <hi>Matrix,</hi> where the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere tartneſſe is turned into meekneſſe: and you ſhould rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it here, that it is not ſo, wholly in the Centre of its being; but (as I may ſay in a ſimilitude) it is as if Oyle were generated in the Meekneſſe, out of which the Light ſhineth conſtantly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for ever, in which the flaſh looſeth its propriety, and ſo out of its forme a ſhining and light is produced, wherein there is a<note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Severall.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Centre,</hi> out of which the Great Joy ſpringeth up; and yet the firſt foure formes keep their own Centre to themſelves: For the Darkneſſe remaineth as an incloſed thing: <hi>and the Light ſhineth in the Darkneſſe, and the Darkneſſe comprehendeth it not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="75">75. Thus there are <hi>two</hi> Principles; which are therefore two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Meekneſſe exiſteth out of the firſt Eternall Will, which [Will] is <hi>free</hi> from the Matrix [or Nature] and is as thin as if it were nothing and is ſtill and quiet. Now that which is ſtill and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a being in it ſelfe, that hath <hi>no darkneſſe</hi> in it; but is meerly a ſtill cleere light Joy, without Eſſence, and that is the Eternity which is without any thing, and is called God, above all other things: for there is nothing <hi>Evill</hi> in it, and it is <hi>without</hi> a Beeing.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. Underſtand us thus; God the Father is ſo in himſelfe, but <hi>without</hi> a Name: for he is in himſelfe the light cleere bright Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without a <hi>Beeing,</hi> if wee ſpeake meerely of the Light of God.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. But ſince he <hi>will not</hi> be without a Beeing, therefore wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his will, which he conceiveth in himſelfe, out of nothing, but meerly out of and in himſelfe; and wee underſtand the deſire [is] in his will, and [that] in the deſire [there is] the Centre of the <hi>Genetrix,</hi> wherein the Beeing is Generated.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. Now the Eternall <hi>Genetrix</hi> deſireth nothing but the Word, which doth create in the Genetrix: for the Eternall ſtill and light Joy, <hi>createth nothing,</hi> but is meerly ſtill and light; for where there is no darkneſſe, there is meere light without alteration; but the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrix</hi> in the deſire maketh the attraction; ſo that there is a Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is Eternall; wherein Nature is Generated: as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. And now the Eternall Genetrix, in the firſt longing, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61125:16"/> the Liberty, (<hi>viz.</hi> God) and not the Darkneſſe, in it ſelfe: for he willeth not her, but the <hi>Word,</hi> which createth in the longing of the Genetrix: and yet there can be no Genetrix without the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, which impregnateth it ſelfe in the will, in which impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the Centre of the Nature doth conſiſt: and there would be no <hi>Word,</hi> if there were no <hi>Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="80">80. For the Word taketh its originall in Nature: and wee heere give you highly and dearly to underſtand, that <hi>two words</hi> are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in Nature: <hi>one</hi> is the firſt Centre of the Genetrix, in the ſterne Wrath, to expreſſe the ſtrong might of the Mother of the firſt ſoure wrathfulneſſe in the Fire: which is heere called the Nature of God the Father, which he thus generateth in his ſtill Joy, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his will, without touching the Liberty of the Light.</p>
                     <p n="81">81. And the <hi>other</hi> Word, [is that] which<note n="n" place="margin">God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> he generateth out of Nature out of the Meekneſſe, underſtand [that] wherein the Eternall Liberty of the Light is, which is called God, which is<note n="o" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> ariſeth out of Nature.</note> out of Nature, and ſo the dark nature <hi>diſappeareth,</hi> [which is] ſtill in the fire of the ſharpneſſe, as is mentioned before, and yet the ſoure aſtringency (in its own dark propriety) is terrified, and looſeth its eagar propriety.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. For the flaſh maketh the dark ſtern Might <hi>thin</hi> againe, and ſo a ſprout ſpringeth up therein out of the innumerable Eſſences, and this is the vertue or power of the <hi>ſecond Centre:</hi> for in this ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up there is a Love-deſire, and the Eternall Light catcheth hold of the Liberty<note n="p" place="margin">Extra Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> without Nature, ſo that the Liberty<note n="p" place="margin">Extra Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> without Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture kindleth in this <hi>Love,</hi> and becometh a burning Light, wherein the Glance or <hi>brightneſſe</hi> ariſeth.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. For there is <hi>no</hi> Glance<note n="p" place="margin">Extra Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> without Nature, though indeed there is a <hi>light</hi> pleaſant habitation: but the Glance ariſeth firſt from the ſharpneſſe: and yet in the ſpringing up of Love there is <hi>no ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> that is perceptible, though indeed it is really; and ſo it is a Birth of Joy, and a right fulfilling of the firſt Will, which is Gods, which he putteth into deſiring, and ſo Generateth Nature, and <hi>out of Nature</hi> [he generateth] the ſprout [or word] of Love.</p>
                     <p n="84">84. Thus the ſecond Sprout (or Word) of Love dwelleth in the Firſt Will, and is its right <hi>fulfilling</hi> which it<note n="q" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> wherein it is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> deſireth: for<note n="r" place="margin">The Love.</note> it is meeke pleaſant and friendly, and is the vertue and heart of the firſt Will, from whence the Eternall Deſire continually<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> Expreſſeth its Eſſentiall Word.</note> is <hi>ſprouting</hi> and ſubſiſting.</p>
                     <p n="85">85. And thus the Light breaketh open the Gates of Darkneſſe, and the loving Sprout [or ſecond Word which is the heart of God] <hi>ſpringeth up</hi> out of the Dark Nature, and dwelleth in the Eternall Stillneſſe of the Father, and is called his Sonne: for the Father Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth him out of his Eternall Will, and herein is the Glance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61125:17"/>
[Luſtre, Glory, or Majeſty] of the Father <hi>manifeſted,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (in the firſt Will in the Dark Nature) appeareth only in <hi>Fire;</hi> but in the ſecond Centre, [it appeareth] in the Love in the Light; and here Love and Enmity ought to be conſidered, and how they <hi>oppoſe</hi> one another.</p>
                     <p n="86">86. For Love is Death to Wrathfulneſſe, and by its ſhining ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>away</hi> the Power of the Wrathfulneſſe. And heere the Power of God in Love and Anger, is rightly to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="87">87. But that the Love may thus be Generated, is cauſed by the firſt Will from the ſtill habitation; for the ſtill and cleere habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is without a ſource, deſireth no fierceneſſe, and yet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fierceneſſe: and if the fierceneſſe were not, there would be no ſharpneſſe; and ſo the <hi>ſecond</hi> Centre (of Love) would not be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated neither, out of which the <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> light ſhineth, where then the Name of God the Father and of God the Sonne exiſteth.</p>
                     <p n="88">88. For if the Eternall Liberty did not Generate the Beeing of Nature, there would be <hi>no</hi> Father, but a meere nothing: but ſince it <hi>doth generate</hi> the Beeing of Nature, therefore the <hi>Generator</hi> whence it is Generated is <hi>called</hi> Father.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. Thus <hi>the Light ſhineth in the Darkneſſe, and the Darkneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it not,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, and thus Light and Darkneſſe are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite one to another, and ſo the Light is <hi>Lord</hi> over the Darkneſſe: and it is an <hi>Eternall Band,</hi> where one would not be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and heere we are rightly to conſider the Enmity againſt the vertue of the Light of God, how each of them taketh its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
                     <p n="90">90.

                     <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen thus ſhew you the way of the Light, the Spirit is pleaſed, not to ſpeake barely as in a Hiſtory, but to ſet forth the <hi>Light</hi> in its higheſt Depth in its <hi>Wellſpring</hi> or Fountaine, that you might looke as through an opened Seale, <hi>in Ternarium Sanctum,</hi> into the holy Ternary, [or the Eternall Eſſentiality.]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For ſeeing the hidden Myſtery of the Kingdome of God, ſhall be revealed in the ſeaventh Seale, and the Lamb himſelfe ſhall be Shepheard over the ſheep, therefore it muſt <hi>not be ſealed up:</hi> for wee have knowne the voyce of the Trumpet of the ſeaventh Seale <hi>in Ternario Sancto,</hi> in the holy Ternary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>wee may well</hi> ſpeake of our native Countrey, to which our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour [or Journey] tendeth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. None ſhould ſuppoſe us to be ignorant, in that wee write ſo very deeply; for if wee did not ſee and know it, wee muſt be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; it is a common ſaying, <hi>What the heart is full of, that the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> This [which wee have written] was not ſought by this Hand: but it is written; <hi>I am found of them that ſought mee not, neither did they enquire after mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. I was as ſimple concerning the hidden Myſteries, as the meaneſt of all; but my Virgin of the Wonders of God, taught mee, ſo that I muſt write of his wonders: though indeed my purpoſe is to write this for a <hi>Memorandum</hi> to my ſelfe, and yet I ſhall ſpeake as for <hi>many,</hi> which is knowne to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And now being to ſpeake of the ſeaventh forme of Nature, wee ſee that the Corporeity eſpecially ſubſiſteth therein, for a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is voyde [or crude] without a body: whereas there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding without a body; and moreover the Spirit it ſelfe, doth not ſubſiſt without a body. For a forme in the Spirit, is a hunger, and a longing deſire, of one forme after another.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 For all things ſtand in the will, and are driven on in the will; for if I have [or<note n="r" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> purpoſe not.</note> 
                        <hi>conceive</hi>] no will to goe, my body ſtandeth ſtill; Therefore my will carrieth mee, and if I have no deſire towards a place, then there is alſo no will in mee: but if I deſire any thing, then that is the will of the<note n="ſ" place="margin">The work or Deeds.</note> Eſſences.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And yet the Eſſences deſire nothing but preſervation and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance of the body, for the body is food: and the whole Eſſence of all Eſſences, is a continuall hunger and ſatiating [or fulfilling], and a regeneration or propagation from its fullneſſe: as may be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61125:27"/> ſeene, that each forme of the Spirit deſireth the other in its hunger, and when that is attained, another or <hi>ſecond</hi> forme ariſeth out of it, and yet the <hi>firſt</hi> doth not vaniſh, but the other or ſecond formeth it ſelfe in the firſt, into another ſource or property, and yet both keep one in another, each in its own property: as wee have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Nature, in ſix formes; how one proceedeth from the other, and how one cauſeth the other, that it be generated, and yet each keepeth its <hi>property</hi> in the other; and there now they ſtand in ſix formes one in another.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And ſo there is no place of reſt, but there is a conſtant deſire of all the ſix formes, as a hunger out of which the will is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generated: and yet there is nothing wherein reſt can be, but the ſtill Eternity: and yet alſo this cannot be apprehended or found in the <hi>Wheele</hi> of the fiery Eſſences: and therefore the hungry Nature ſeeketh in its Mother, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the deſire of the ſoureneſſe), and the ſoureneſſe catcheth hold of the <hi>deſire</hi> of the Eſſences, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it faſt: and thus all Eſſences of the hunger are held in the ſoure Mother, for ſhee is their onely reſt, which they fill againe with that which is in them, that is, with themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And herein conſiſteth the Dominion of a Spirit: for Nature doth conſiſt not onely in ſeaven formes, but there may (out of every deſire,) againe a will be generated, wherein the Eſſences ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt againe, but <hi>alterably,</hi> according to the deſire of that will, where there is no number found, as you may ſee in the Creation of the World.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But ſeeing the Eternall Eſſence doth deſire a certain<note n="t" place="margin">Marke, or pitch of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription.</note> bound or limit, further and more then which, or to goe higher, or to be other, it deſireth not; <hi>therefore</hi> the heart generateth it ſelfe, which is <hi>the end of Nature,</hi> and the heart is the fulfilling of the Eternall [Beeing, Eſſence, or Subſtance.]</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And the heart is not comprehenſible by Nature, but Nature remaineth in the darkneſſe in it ſelfe, and the heart remaineth in it ſelfe in the light: and <hi>neither</hi> would be manifeſt without the other; and yet there is a continuall hunger in them both, for both have wrought from Eternity, viz. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Now thus wee ſee, in the Angelicall world, as alſo in this world, that the ſeaventh Forme of Nature, is a<note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Eſſentiall.</hi>

                        <p n="13">13. THis wee demonſtrate to you, in Light and Darkneſſe; for wee cannot ſay that the Darkneſſe is the ſource [or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty], but the Darkneſſe<note n="y" place="margin">Begirteth.</note> encompaſſeth the ſource [or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty], and cauſeth that a ſource of Anguiſh of the longing and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is <hi>[generated]</hi> in it, for the Darkneſſe hath no deſiring, but the deſiring is generated in it, and the Darkneſſe cauſeth the deſiring; <hi>viz.</hi> that there is <hi>conceived</hi> a deſire to be free from the Darkneſſe; and <hi>therefore</hi> the deſiring laboureth ſo eagerly after the liberty, till the Anguiſh in the ſharp deſiring,<note n="z" place="margin">Eſpieth, or attaineth.</note> diſcovereth the liberty in it ſelfe, and yet there it is not [rightly called] the Liberty, though it be the Liberty, but it ſtandeth in the ſharpneſſe of the Anguiſh, and is called Fire, where the deſiring then can goe <hi>no higher;</hi> but muſt be ſtifled in it ſelfe, and muſt ſink down into the ſource.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. And the ſharpneſſe of the flaſh of the fire, in the Liberty of the ſharpneſſe, holdeth its right, like a ſtill ſource [or property] ſtanding in the <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> of the Liberty: and the ſinking of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh is as it were a <hi>Death,</hi> out of which the Life is generated: which Death, affordeth<note n="a" place="margin">Ponderoſity.</note> 
                           <hi>weight:</hi> for it is (being compared with the fire of the Liberty) like a ſinking downe in it ſelfe: and in its ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Anguiſh becometh materiall, ſo that, in that Death, the whole forme of the ſource [or property] may be found, as I may ſay, palpably, or<note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>feelingly.</hi>
                           </note> ſenſibly: and the ſenſibility, is the Corporiety of the Darkneſſe; and the fire of the Liberty in the fierce flaſh, is its Spirit and Life.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. And hereby you are adviſed, to enter into your ſelves, and [you may ſee, that the fire cauſeth the feeling [or ſenſibility] in the ſharpneſſe of the dead Corporeity: for without fire there is <hi>no body,</hi> that hath any ſenſibility [or feeling], as you may ſee by the Earth and Stones.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Now therefore it is here further declared to you, that the body or ſubſtantiality, is not <hi>ſo dead a thing,</hi> that it is altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and fit for nothing: for the ſtifling driveth its property or ſource downwards, and <hi>affordeth weight,</hi> and the fire driveth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and <hi>giveth Spirit, Life, and Mobility.</hi> And now between theſe two in the midſt, is the Centre of the deſiring Anguiſh, which is a cauſe of that which is uppermoſt, that is, the fire, and alſo of that which is nethermoſt, that is, the ſubſtantiality; and if the Centre cannot get upwards nor downwards, and yet driveth with its deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; then it driveth forth <hi>ſidewayes,</hi> and the whole forme or figure

Thus wee diſtinguiſh to you, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in the darkneſſe, and though wee are very hard to be underſtood by you: and though alſo little beliefe may be afforded to it: yet wee have a very <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> proofe of it: not onely in the created<note n="e" place="margin">Geſternte, Conſtellation, or firmament, <hi>aliter</hi> Geiſterne Spirits.</note> Heaven, but alſo in the Centre of the Earth, as alſo in the whole Principle of this world, which would be too long, to ſet down here, but wee will diſcuſſe, and ſet down a <hi>few things,</hi> to open the underſtanding of the Reader.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Conſider the Centre of the Earth, which God hath created by his Word, even out of the Centre of the Deepe Eternity, out of the Darkneſſe, out of the Centre of the deſirous Will: but not out of any <hi>ſeverall Place,</hi> but out of the ſpace and Depth, ſo farre as the Word hath yeelded it ſelfe unto the<note n="f" place="margin">Receptacle or devourer.</note> 
                           <hi>Ether,</hi> there hath the Centre been <hi>every where,</hi> and is ſo now, and remaineth ſo in Eternity: for it hath been ſo from Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. And this is the beginning that the Word hath created [or conceived] a <hi>Will</hi> in the Darkneſſe, to manifeſt the Darkneſſe with all its formes, of the Wonders of God the Father, <hi>in his Nature</hi> which he generateth in his Eternall Will: and wee demonſtrate it to you thus: Behold the Earth, Stones, and Metalls, which are all of them as it were dead and afford weight; and alſo they are dark, <hi>[opaca],</hi>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61125:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> and yet have <hi>in them</hi> the light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Noble <hi>Tincture,</hi> which is their light and life; wherein the <hi>Oare</hi> [or Minerall] ſtone doth grow, in which the Tincture is ſtrong.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Thus you ſee alſo, how the Brimſtony Fire is the Overcomer of Nature, in which the <hi>Tincture</hi> doth exiſt, and ſo through the Death of Nature ſpringeth up, in Stones and Metalls; and in Nature bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the <hi>ſubſtantiality</hi> of the ſhining and glance or brightneſſe; which may be ſeene, in gold, ſilver, and all gliſtering Metalls. Wherein alſo wee<note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>finde.</hi>
                           </note> ſee the poyſonous anguiſh of the Darkneſſe, as alſo the ſoure death of the Darkneſſe, and the ſtrong matter of<note n="h" place="margin">Mixture or Copulation.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; as they underſtand, who <hi>worke</hi> and deale therein.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. Alſo wee ſee how the <hi>Tincture</hi> can bring that which is loweſt in the Death, to its higheſt Ornament or Glory, (viz. <hi>an inferiour Metall into Gold</hi>), and all that, in reſpect of the great power of the Eternity. And therefore alſo the Tincture is <hi>hidden</hi> from the <hi>Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> becauſe it is originally out of the Eternity, and they ſeeke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is <hi>Earthly;</hi> if they did rightly ſeeke, they ſhould well <hi>finde</hi> it, as wee have found in the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. But wee have yet a greater knowledge of this, in the many materialls or kindes of Earth: which wee know, to be created out of the Eternall Eſſences, as an Out birth, and ſo are in ſubſtance as an Image of the Eſſences; where wee may ſee the<note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>changing.</hi>
                           </note> altering of the Will in the Eſſences, and the Great Wonders of the <hi>Omnipotency</hi> of God.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. For all things, which are come to an Eſſence, proceeded out of the Eternall <hi>Genetrix,</hi> not at ſeverall times, but all at once; yet ſtood [or were manifeſted] in ſeverall times, in the forming of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Subſtance, (in the wreſtling of the <hi>Centre</hi>) in the Figure, and were ſeene by the Heart of God in the Light, which at length created it; where the Time took its beginning.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. For the Deity hath had a <hi>longing,</hi> to ſee the Wonders of the Eternall Nature, and of the innumerable Eſſences, in ſubſtance, and in corporeall things; and wee give you to underſtand this highly and exactly: that God hath created all for the Light, and not the Darkneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. For, he hath awakened the <hi>Tincture,</hi> to the Death in the Centre (<hi>viz.</hi> to the Body or Corporeall ſubſtance of the Earth) and that is its Luſtre and Light, wherein its <hi>life</hi> doth conſiſt. And, to the Deepe above the Centre, he hath given the <hi>Sunne,</hi> which is a Tincture of the Fire, and reacheth with its vertue into the Liberty, <hi>beyond</hi> Nature, wherein alſo it retaineth its Glance or Luſtre: and it [the Sun] is the <hi>Life</hi> of the whole wheele of the Starres, and an Opener of Death, in the Chamber of Anguiſh, [or in the wrathfull Nature]: For, <hi>all</hi> the Starres are its Children, not that they have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61125:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> their Eſſences from it, but it is their life, and in the beginning, they proceeded from its <hi>Centre,</hi> it is the <hi>Centre</hi> of the uppermoſt in the Liberty of the Life, and the Earth is the Centre of the nethermoſt in the Death; and yet there is no dying in either of them, but an altering of one<note n="k" place="margin">Beeing, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> thing into another.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. For this World <hi>dyeth not,</hi> but it ſhall be changed into ſuch a ſubſtance, as it was not before; (underſtand its Eſſences): but the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of all things remaine ſtanding for ever as a <hi>figure,</hi> to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, joy and [manifeſtation of] Gods works of wonder.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. And further wee give you to underſtand, that the Spirits alſo were all created unto the Light; for they are the <hi>Eſſences</hi> [or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding powers] out of the Life; not out of the Corporeity of the Death, but out of the Centre of the Eſſences in the <hi>Originall</hi> of the Tincture, which reacheth the Liberty of God the Father, which is light, joy, or a habitation of Eternity, wherein the Word with the Angelicall world hath its <hi>dominion.</hi> They all are created out of the ſharpneſſe of the twinckling in the wheele of the Eſſences: and they ſtand in the <hi>Liberty</hi> before the Heart of God, and they are the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the divine delight, which are<note n="l" place="margin">Beheld, or aſpected.</note> diſcovered by the Heart, in the Wonders of the Power, and therefore it ſet the Will in the Fiat, and created them.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. And wee underſtand by the word [<hi>Schuffe,</hi> which ſignifieth] Created, [and in the Language of Nature ſignifieth] a Seperation of the Eſſences, in the Centre, in the ſoure <hi>Matrix:</hi> and therefore there is alſo ſuch great diverſity in the Spirits, as there is great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in the Will of the Eſſences; whereof wee have an Example and ſimilitude in the will [and purpoſe] of our <hi>Minde,</hi> out of which, do ſpring ſo many various <hi>thoughts,</hi> where every thought hath againe a Centre to a Will: that ſo out of a<note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</note> conceived thought, a ſubſtance may be [produced]. [For Example, a Woman with childe, <hi>can with her thoughts,</hi> ſet a mark, or make ſome monſtrous alteration, in the fruit of her womb, which is a ſubſtantiall thing.]</p>
                        <p n="31">31. In ſuch a manner, are all Spirits created out of the <hi>Eternall Minde,</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> they are alſo Eternall; for all whatſoever is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated out of the Eternall Minde, is Eternall.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. For before God had conceived the <hi>Fiat,</hi> the wheele of the Eternall Eſſences, went forth without ſubſtance, into the Wonders: but when God ſet the will in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> then the wheele of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Eſſences, went forth into a ſubſtance, and there the Time, had its beginning, which was <hi>not</hi> from Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. And wee give you highly to underſtand, the heavy fall of <hi>Lucifer;</hi> which [was that] he put his will back, againe, into the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Fire, in the <hi>Centre,</hi> and turned away from the will of the Eternall Minde, which tendeth onely to the Heart of God;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61125:29"/> and would domineere in the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Roote (<hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> of the Fire) over the Heart of God: for the fierce power of the Fire, delighted him more then the Meekneſſe in the ſtill habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore he was thruſt back alſo, (into the dark <hi>Matrix,</hi> into the anguiſhing Minde) in the ſinking down of Death.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. But to ſatisfie the high enquiring minde, and to fill its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, concerning what moved <hi>Lucifer</hi> to this, wee offer the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the <hi>Genetrix,</hi> to be conſidered; and there you finde all the Formes, which can be found in the whole Nature.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. For you finde there the ſoure, bitter, dark, tart, ſtinging, envious [property or forme] which ſtand all in the Centre of the Genetrix, <hi>before</hi> the kindling of the Light.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. But when God ſet his will in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> and deſired to create Spirits: it was no other then as when God ſaid to the <hi>Matrix</hi> [or womb] of the Third Principle, of this world; <hi>Bring forth all ſorts of Beaſts, Fowles, Fiſhes, and Wormes, every one after its kinde,</hi> underſtand, that their body is according to the kinde or quality of their Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo is the Subſtance or Eſſence in the body, which is their ſpirit: and ſo alſo it is with the high Spirits: there went forth out of the Eternall <hi>Matrix,</hi> Spirits, out of all Eſſences, which are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to our account.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. And as wee have ſhewne you already, concerning the ſeaven formes of the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Eternall Nature, where every forme is a ſeverall wellſpring of Nature; in like manner, out of every forme, out of every wellſpring, goe forth <hi>Spirits,</hi> according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Eſſences and properties, every one according to its kinde.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. And the uppermoſt Principall Dominion, proceedeth from the Head-ſource, which is the cauſe of the multiplicity therein, as the minde is a cauſe of the ſenſes or various thoughts;] and wee intreate you to conſider the <hi>Matrix</hi> earneſtly; wherein you ſhall quickly know, the Conceived Will of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> what it is in its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; how the Creature hath imagined into the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſelfe to be withheld there; and yet God created all Spirits<note n="n" place="margin">To or for.</note> in the Light.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. For the Tincture of the friendly habitation, ſhined out of them all, and the Heart of God ſhined to them, [like the Lamb in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi>] and they <hi>ſhould</hi> put their Imagination into it, and frame their will and power, <hi>in verbo Domini,</hi> in the Word of the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. But being they ſaw, that the <hi>Verbum Domini,</hi> the Word of the Lord, in the Centre, was as another [or ſecond] birth out of the Centre: and that they were generated out of the Eſſences of the great fountaine: which is, the Nature of Eternity; they <hi>deſpiſed</hi> the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61125:30"/> humility, out of which the Love and Light is generated, and <hi>would</hi> domineere (in the fierce power, in the ſource of the Fire) over the Humility: for the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Fire <hi>deſired</hi> to have the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. For wee cannot know any otherwiſe, then that <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created in the fourth forme of the Matrix: for there ſtand the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Love in oppoſition, and this is the ſtrife and overcoming, where the Light overcometh and holdeth the Darkneſſe captive. [The Fourth forme is in the midſt of the ſeaven formes, and <hi>may turne</hi> it ſelfe to the Three in the Anger, or to the Three in the Love of God: and is ſeverally drawne and deſired by <hi>each</hi> of the Three.]</p>
                        <p n="42">42. Alſo the Wrath and Zeale of the Eternall Nature of God, <hi>deſired</hi> to be creaturely, and to ſhew forth its wonders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="o" place="margin">The Spirits or fallen Angells.</note> they were held in the fountaine of their <hi>own</hi>

                           </note> Nature; and they have kindled the Matrix of the fierceneſſe of the Anger and Envy, ſo that now it is <hi>their</hi> Eternall Habitation.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. The <hi>Tincture</hi> (in their Conceived Will) is become <hi>falſe;</hi> becauſe they would domineere (out of their Pride) over the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Heart of God: and therefore they were caſt out of the uppermoſt Centre into the nethermoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>Death;</hi> where is nothing but meere Darkneſſe, and they cannot reach the Light of God.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. For, to the Light of God, there belongeth a<note n="q" place="margin">Humble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</note> Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Humility, wherein the deſire of Love is Generated, which apprehendeth the Heart of God; And this, <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath not, but meere anger, envy, and high-mindedneſſe, and a continuall deſire to flie up above the Heart of God, and to domineere in the ſterne Might: and therefore he is thruſt out from the Divine Principle, into the Centre of Darkneſſe, and that is his Eternall Kingdome.</p>
                        <p n="45">45. And here is cleerely ſhewne to the<note n="r" place="margin">Theologues cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Divines.</note> 
                           <hi>Theologiſts,</hi> who <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> to preach of the Will of God; that their devices, about wayes to God, are <hi>meere</hi> Fables: when they make Lawes, and ſet down things, as the meanes whereby the Light of God may be attained: For it onely conſiſteth in this, and it lyeth in our<note n="ſ" place="margin">Purpoſe or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolution.</note> Imagination, that wee frame our will into <hi>Humility,</hi> wherein the Love is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which penetrateth to the Heart of God, as into that which is its own, where the humane ſoule is then, borne in God, ſo that it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the will of God, to doe that which is the will of God.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. For, <hi>All</hi> mens <hi>doings,</hi> without the will of God, are nothing elſe but<note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> Foolery, humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Graven Images of naturall skill, which <hi>remaine</hi> in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the Centre: and it is a ſeeking, where nothing is to be found; like one, that maketh a coſtly piece of work, which himſelfe taketh pleaſure in.</p>
                        <p n="47">
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61125:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>47. So alſo, <hi>ſuch works</hi> ſtand before God, as a figure: which yet remaine in the <hi>figure Eternally;</hi> but, to the true <hi>Regeneration,</hi> to the attaining of the Heart of God, there belongeth onely an earneſt will, and ſubmiſſion, where Reaſon lets goe all that it hath invented and contrived, and dependeth meerly on the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Heart of God, and ſo the Spirit is conceived and borne in the Love of God.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. And wee have already cleerly ſhewen you, that every thing is generated out of the Will, and every thing hath its propagation againe in the Will; for the Will is the Maſter <hi>[Artificer]</hi> of every work: for it hath its firſt Originall to Nature, from God the Father, and paſſeth <hi>through</hi> Nature to his Heart, which is the end of Nature, which dwelleth there in the ſtill Eternall Liberty without Nature, and is in Nature, as a peculiar Principle of its own in it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. Thus the Originall of Nature hath the ſecond Principle, out of which proceed thoſe things or ſubſtances, that may be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the Principle of the Heart of God doth not [alter or change].</p>
                        <p n="50">50. Therefore I ſay ſtill, and it is the very truth; that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is built, invented, and taught, concerning the Way to God, (if it proceed not out of the <hi>Humility of Love,</hi> and goeth on to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending [or purpoſe] of the Will, to the Heart of God,) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an<note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> Graven Image, trifle, or foppery.</note> Invented work, in the Wonders of God: whereby the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, which ſtand in the <hi>hidden ſeales,</hi> are brought to light: and the builders [or contrivers], are but labourers in the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, in the great building, to the Glory of God, which [building] <hi>ſhall appeare,</hi> in the Wonders, at the change of Time, when all things ſhall enter into the<note n="x" place="margin">Receptacle, or devourer.</note> 
                           <hi>Ether.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="51">51. Yet we doe not judge, nor condemne, the <hi>deſirous ſeeker,</hi> who ſeeketh in blindneſſe, and knoweth not what he doth; ſeeing he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth in the building of the Great Wonders of God, [with a blinde Zeale]. For he ſhall finde his <hi>reward</hi> in the end, in as much as he hath had a will, to preſſe in to God, and yet ſticketh in the building.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. And when the building ſhall appeare before God, at the end of Time, then the <hi>Artificer</hi> or Workmaſter ſhall alſo appeare before God. But doe wee alone ſay this? Doth not the Scripture in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſay; That <hi>our works ſhall follow us, where every one ſhall reape what he hath ſowne?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="53">53. Therefore leave off your calumnies and blaſphemies, and your fine contrived wayes to God; and forſake the covetouſneſſe and high-mindedneſſe of the Devill, and enter into the way of <hi>Love,</hi> which conſiſteth in Humility (towards the Heart of God,) in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath opened againe the hidden ſeales, wherewith wee in

But if it reach not the Ground, it ſinketh downe in the Ground, and cannot apprehend it, and then cometh doubting, unbeliefe, and contempt, into the Minde, [as if this writing were not worth the troubling ones head about it,] therefore wee would have the Reader admoniſhed, not to jeſt with the high hidden Myſteries; for thereby the Spirit of God is blaſphemed.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. And it is with the Minde, as with <hi>Lucifer:</hi> when he ſaw the greateſt hidden Myſteries of the Deity ſtand in ſuch humility, he took offence at it, and entered into the fierce Might of the Fire, and <hi>would</hi> domineere with his own ſelfe, wit, and reaſon, over [the Heart of] God, he <hi>would</hi> that God ſhould be in ſubjection under him, he <hi>would</hi> be the framer and Creator in Nature, and therefore he became a Devill.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. For in the meekneſſe and lowlineſſe, conſiſteth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, with the Angelicall world, and the vertue of the Heart of God.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. For the Light conſiſteth in <hi>meekneſſe:</hi> and though it hath its Originall out of the Centre of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the ſharpneſſe of God, yet it placeth its Centre in very great Meekneſſe: for the Liberty without Nature is the End of Nature: and the Light dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Liberty, as a Glance or brightneſſe of a ſtill<note n="c" place="margin">Habitation.</note> Joy: and the <hi>Word</hi> [proceeding] out of the powers of Nature, is the Fire of the Light, out of which the ſhining goeth forth, and enlighteneth the whole Deepe of the Father; ſo that it is <hi>one</hi> Eſſence together, but with <hi>three</hi> Diſtinctions, where every Diſtinction hath a Centre, and may be called a <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="64">64. For, the Father generateth the Nature out of the Eternall ſtill Liberty, which is himſelfe, and yet in the ſtillneſſe is <hi>not</hi> called Father: but in that he is deſiring [or Generating], and<note n="d" place="margin">Conceiveth, frameth, or purpoſeth.</note> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth a Will in himſelfe, to [have] the Genetrix of Nature [to be], <hi>there</hi> he is knowne to be a Father, from whom all things proceede, as out of his firſt Will, through all Wills.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. Even as the <hi>Minde</hi> of Man, is but one onely will, which is deſiring, and yet conceiveth in it, out of the Eternall Will, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Wills, and one alwayes goeth forth out of the other. Whereby wee ſee and finde, that the firſt Will is Maſter, and the other recomprehended Wills leade to Light and Darkneſſe, to joy and ſorrow, according as they conceive any thing good or evill in them; as Reaſon can diſcerne. So it is alſo in the Father, in Nature,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61125:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> but <hi>not</hi> in the Liberty, for there, there is nothing in himſelfe, but the Light Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. Beeing then a twofold comprehenſion thus proceedeth out of one will, as, to joy and ſorrow, love and hate, therefore each hath its <hi>birth</hi> to<note n="e" place="margin">

Thus there is a <hi>twofold</hi> driving in one onely ſubſtance, and therefore alſo <hi>two Centres</hi> are generated, the one tendeth to meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the other to fierceneſſe, and yet are not ſevered: for the fierceneſſe in Nature is the <hi>firſt,</hi> and out of the fierceneſſe is the meekneſſe generated, which is the <hi>other,</hi> and one without the other, would be onely a ſtill Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. Therefore now, the Meekneſſe is the Sonne of God, which dwelleth in the ſtill Eternity, and<note n="f" place="margin">Satiateth, quencheth, or alayeth.</note> 
                           <hi>mitigateth</hi> the Wrath, and is therefore called the <hi>Sonne,</hi> becauſe he is Generated out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Nature: and is called the Word of the Father, becauſe he is with the Glance of the Eternall Liberty, [proceeding] out of the Eternall Liberty (out of the Wheele of the Eſſences, out of the Formes of Nature, as the life of Nature) expreſſed in the Liberty of the Father; and is called a Perſon, becauſe he is a ſelfe ſubſiſting<note n="g" place="margin">Subſtance, beeing, or thing.</note> Eſſence, which doth not belong to the Birth of Nature, but is the life and underſtanding of Nature: and is called the Heart of the Father, becauſe he is the vertue and power in the Centre of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he is in Nature, as the Heart in the Body, which giveth ſtrength and underſtanding to its Members: and is called the Light of God, becauſe the Light is <hi>kindled</hi> in him, and taketh its originall in him: and is called the Glance [or brightneſſe], becauſe, in the Eternall ſtill Liberty, he maketh a Glance [or Luſtre], which taketh its originall out of the <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> of the Eternall Nature, as is mentioned before. And he is called the <hi>Love</hi> of the Father, becauſe the firſt Will of the Father to the <hi>Genetrix</hi> of Nature, deſireth only this his moſt beloved Heart, and this (in the Will of the Father) is the beſt beloved above Nature, and yet is his Eſſence. And is called <hi>Wonder,</hi> becauſe he is the Creator of all things, by whom all things out of the Centre of the Eſſences of the Father, are brought to light, and beeing; ſo that the Nature of the Father ſtandeth in Great Wonders.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. And this is the diverſity, [and the cauſe] that the Father and the Sonne are called <hi>two</hi> Perſons, and yet are but <hi>one</hi> God in one onely Eſſence, that is, the Father is the Generator of Nature, becauſe it is Generated by his Will, out of the deſire; and becauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61125:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Heart ſevereth it ſelfe from Nature, and is not comprehended by Nature, and exerciſeth a ſeverall Centre, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Love;</hi> and the Father exerciſeth the Centre of <hi>Wrath:</hi> in the ſharpneſſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the Fire, and in the ſharpneſſe of the Sonne, is the Light, and yet they are in one another, as fire and Light.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. But as the Fire will be free (or elſe it is ſmothered) and yet it burneth out of the dark ſappy wood; ſo is the Divine Nature alſo free from the inward wrathfull darkneſſe: and though the fire burne out of diverſity of materialls, yet it affordeth but one kinde of ſource or property, <hi>viz.</hi> heate and light; And in the ſame manner alſo you muſt underſtand us, concerning the Deity.</p>
                        <p n="71">71. The Sonne, is in Light Eternity of the Father, (and in his comprehended will) in his Nature, but <hi>one</hi> only ſource, which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Love and Light, and is the Glance of the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cannot be ſevered or <hi>diſunited</hi> from the Father; For there is but one will in him, which is called the deſire of Mercy <hi>[Barm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hertzigkeit],</hi> and that is atrractive of whatſoever inclineth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it</p>
                        <p n="72">72. And the Holy Ghoſt is the Third Perſon; which I formerly called the Spirit <hi>Mercurius,</hi> in the Divine Nature; in reſpect of its Property; For you ſee that every Will in it ſelfe, is ſtill, and every Light is ſtill, and the noiſe maketh the Will manifeſt, which then ſtandeth before the Will, and maketh <hi>another Centre.</hi> For the noiſe or ſound is comprehended and carried forth, but the Will is not ſo; which you may perceive by a word, how that is comprehended and carried forth, which is generated in the noiſe. And you know alſo, how the noiſe hath its beginning in the Heart, and goeth forth out of the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of the Will, and is compriſed in the Mouth, and yet preſſeth forth out of the Heart, and ſoundeth out from the <hi>whole</hi> Perſon: and declareth what is in the Will.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. And wee finde alſo, that the <hi>noiſe</hi> is the awakener of the life, alſo the<note n="h" place="margin">

                        <p n="74">74. And ſecondly, wee perceive, that the <hi>Aire</hi> which preſſeth forth from the Heart, comprehendeth the<note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sound.</hi>
                           </note> noiſe, and in the mouth, maketh a Centre, where the will formeth the Word, and the will which thruſteth forth from the heart, bringeth the noiſe of the will, in the conceived Centre, which exiſteth in the mouth out from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61125:33"/> Centre of the mouth: and that noiſe is ſharpe, and penetrateth through the heart, minde, and ſenſes: for it is gone forth out of the Centre, into another [Thing or] Eſſence, as into another minde, and bringeth with its ſharpneſſe that [minde or Eſſence] into its will: and if that will [or the other minde] pleaſeth it not, it <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> that will, and deſtroyeth it, <hi>viz.</hi> puniſheth that minde, which is not<note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>

                        <p n="75">75. Thus my beloved ſeeking and deſiring Minde; Conſider thy ſelfe, ſearch thy ſelfe, and finde thy ſelfe; thou art the Similitude, Image, Eſſence, and proper portion of God; and as thou art, ſo is the Eternall <hi>Birth</hi> in God For God is a Spirit, and the<note n="l" place="margin">

                        <p n="76">76. For God hath manifeſted himſelfe in the ſpirit of Man, both in Love and in Anger, <hi>both</hi> the Centres are in it; and the <hi>Third</hi> [Centre] with the <hi>exiſt</hi> of the Spirit is the omnipotency, and if the Spirit of this world, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Third Principle) had not ſet its barre in <hi>Adam,</hi> which is broken by the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is made a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: being borne as a Great Wonder, and ſhewne in the preſence of God.</p>
                        <p n="77">77. Thus in like manner wee acknowledge a <hi>Third</hi> Perſon in the Deity, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. For he is the Spirit of the mouth of God, and hath not his originall in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but is the ſpirit of the firſt will to Nature, yet he getteth his ſharpneſſe in Nature: and therefore he is the <hi>former</hi> and framer in Nature, as moſt powetfull and <hi>omnipotent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="78">78. For he manageth the ſword of Omnipotence, [as may be ſeene by the Image in the <hi>Revelation</hi>] he is the bringer forth, the Conductor, and the Directer: alſo the deſtroyer of malice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and the opener of the <hi>hidden</hi> Myſteries; he exiſteth in the Father from Eternity without beginning: for the Father without him, would be onely an Eternall ſtillneſſe without<note n="m" place="margin">Being, or ſubſtance.</note> Eſſence.</p>
                        <p n="79">79. He is the Eſſence of the Will, as is mentioned concerning the Fire, out of which the Aire ariſeth, which goeth forth from the Fire: and as you ſee that the humane life and its underſtanding, conſiſteth in the <hi>Aire,</hi> and that the Aire governeth the life: ſo you muſt underſtand us concerning the Spirit of God; which is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going and flowing vertue out of the Heart and Word of God.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. For the Heart is the Word: and the Spirit is the former of the Word: not that he maketh the Word, but he is the ſelfe <hi>ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi> Eſſence, when the wheele of the Eſſences in the Centre of the Father, goe on in Triumph as a <hi>Genetrix,</hi> then he is in the wheele, in the appearing [or ſhining] of the Liberty, and openeth the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrix</hi> in the Darkneſſe, and cauſeth the longing, of the other [or ſecond] Will, to the Centre of the Word.</p>

                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61125:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>81. He is the <hi>Key,</hi> in the ſhining of the Will in the Eſſences, and openeth the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the <hi>Genetrix.</hi> He is not comprehended by the Eſſences, nor by the Centre of the Word: but he cloſeth with the Word and Heart, and openeth the Heart to the<note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>

                        <p n="82">82. For the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the <hi>hidden ſeales</hi> in the ſeaven Formes: and they open the Spirit, that it may come to the Will, that ſo out of one forme of the Genetrix, many wills may come, and goe forth, without number <hi>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

He himſelfe is not the Glance, but the power of the Glance, and leadeth the Glance of the Majeſty of God in Triumph: he is the joy of the Deity, and maketh the <hi>Holy</hi> ſport, with his opening, in the hidden ſeales of the Eſſences.</p>
                        <p n="83">83. I give you a ſimilitude of this, in the ſpirit and life of Man: you ſee the Body, which is in it ſelfe, a dark [or <hi>opake</hi>] thing, voyd of underſtanding: it hath indeed the Eſſences, but from the opening of the Spirit; which openeth the Eſſences, and bringeth them to the will, or elſe the body would be <hi>dead,</hi> ſtill, and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
                        <p n="84">84.

Therefore heere wee ſhall be as it were dumb, to thoſe which are not borne of God; for (according to the outward Man) wee are in this world, and according to the inward Man, wee are in God: therefore the ſenſe of the minde ſpeaketh of the Kingdome of Heaven, and the <hi>outward Spirit,</hi> (which is generated from the Principle of this world) ſpeaketh<note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>from.</hi>

                        <p n="34">34. Therefore wee ſpeake of our Child-like Birth in God: for our beginning is upon the Croſſe: wee are created upon the Croſſe as to our ſoule, therefore the Body alſo is a Croſſe: and the Centre, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi>) is in the midſt of the Croſſe: and wee are with <hi>Adam,</hi> gone forth from the Image of the Croſſe, into the Image of the Serpent: But the Sonne of the Virgin, hath <hi>regenerated</hi> us againe on the Croſſe to a Heavenly Image.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. Therefore wee will ſpeake, what wee ſee and know in the Ground, and not be ſilent: for a Croſſe-birth keepeth its Centre <hi>in Ternario ſancto</hi> [in the Holy Ternary] underſtand it right, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly number Three, but not in the Majeſty, which is without Eſſence; but in the <hi>diſtinction</hi> of the Trinity, where the Deity is called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and Holy Spirit, where the two Principles part, the <hi>Holy</hi> and the <hi>Wrathfull,</hi> and there it is that the flaſh maketh a Croſſe, and upon the Croſſe, the Heart of God is generated, [from Eternity

                        <p n="36">36. Therefore it is the Heart of God, for it is the <hi>power</hi> of the Majeſty, and affordeth the<note n="x" place="margin">Glance or Brightneſſe.</note> Luſtre, power, and glory of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>

                        <p n="38">38. For although the wrath in the flaſh inclineth upwards, and alſo<note n="y" place="margin">Croſſe-wiſe, or ſquare.</note> ſide wayes, yet the ſinking down of death is in it alſo: for the flaſh <hi>killeth</hi> the hard ſtrong might; as is ſeene how it diſſipateth the darkneſſe, and yet the ſting of the wrathfulneſſe remaineth in it, where no death is perceived, but ſubſtantiality without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as alſo in the ſinking of the captivated meekneſſe in the Light, there is no underſtanding neither, but <hi>ſubſtantiality,</hi> and yet it hath the <hi>Tincture,</hi> which ſpringeth in the <hi>ſubſtantiality,</hi> and is like a growing: and the underſtanding remaineth meerly in the <hi>Centre</hi> on the Croſſe in the<note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>Trinity.</hi>

                        <p n="39">39. Thus wee ſay the Holy Ghoſt goeth forth from the Father and the Sonne [as the Aire from the nre and the Light] but <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> doth he goe?

Behold! the Word is the Heart, and ſoundeth in the Eſſences [or working powers] of the Father: and the Heart ſpeaketh it in the mouth of the Father, and in the mouth, the Holy Spirit of the Father comprehendeth it, in his Centre, and ſo goeth with it forth, from the Father and the Sonne, <hi>into the ſubſtantiality,</hi> where it ſtandeth with the Glance of the Majeſty, as a Virgin of the Wiſdome of God, <hi>in Ternario Sancto</hi> [in the Holy Ternary].</p>

                        <p n="126">126. For, in the pure Element (out of which the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceed) is the Paradiſe: it is a ſprouting out from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality before God: its life and underſtanding, is the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Number-Three of God, its Light is the Glance of the Majeſty of the Number-Three, the Matter onely is about the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> When the foure Elements in Man, <hi>breake,</hi> then is the ſoule already in the Paradiſe, or in the Abyſſe of the Centre in the Dark <hi>Matrix,</hi> all according to that wherein the ſoule was growne in this [life] time upon Earth.</p>

                        <p n="128">128. But if it be growne in the ſterne wrath, in falſhood and in pride, to flie out above Paradiſe: then it flieth in high-mindedneſſe in the ſterne <hi>Matrix</hi> aloft over Paradiſe out, and cannot get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the Meekneſſe; and there it is in Hell with the proud Devill.</p>
                        <p n="129">129. For after this life, there is no regeneration more; for the foure Elements and the outward Principle (wherein the Genetrix ſtood in the working and Creating) are gone; it hath no more to expect after this Time, but <hi>onely</hi> (when, at the end of this Time, this Principle ſhall goe into the <hi>Ether,</hi> that the ſubſtantiality which hath been from Eternity, ſhall be <hi>free</hi> again) that it ſhall get a body againe out of the property [and ſource] of its <hi>own</hi> Mother, where then all its works in its Mother, ſhall appeare before it.</p>
                        <p n="130">130. For the Laſt Day is onely to awaken againe that which ſlept, and to breake the Death which is in the foure Elements: For the <hi>vayle muſt be done away,</hi> and all that which is generated out of the Eternall, muſt ſpring up againe and live.</p>
                        <p n="131">131. But that which is Generated out of the Death, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the foure Elements, as the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and every living thing of the foure Elements, attaine <hi>no body</hi> any more; and if the ſpirit of it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated onely in the foure Elements, it breaketh with the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, and the <hi>Figure</hi> onely remaineth of the Elementary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of the foure Out-Births.</p>
                        <p n="132">132. But that which is out of the Eternall (out of the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Eternall Life) is and remaineth for ever: even all words and works which are <hi>generated</hi> out of the Eternall, remaine in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the Figure: but they cannot remaine for ever in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and power, for a word of a<note n="r" place="margin">Breath.</note> Spirit doth not proceed from the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but hath its beginning in the outward Principle.</p>
                        <p n="133">133. And therefore every Spirit will have joy and ſorrow in its

For, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhall conſider with it ſelfe, its ſource [or <hi>condition</hi>] and <hi>why</hi> it is in the place where it is, then the ſource or property of its words and works aſcend in it; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it joy or ſorrow, according to the condition or ſource and place that it is in, every one in [that which is] its <hi>own</hi> duly.</p>
                        <p n="134">134.

                        <p n="135">135. From this <hi>Ground</hi> wee know, that <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency before his ſleepe, (which ſignifieth Death, when he had imagined into the ſpirit of the foure Elements) was in this world in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> and yet it might well be ſaid, not in this world; he was indeed in this world upon the face of the Earth, but in a paradiſicall ſource [or property] in the Dominion of the <hi>[one pure] Element,</hi> and not in the foure Elements.</p>
                        <p n="136">136. But when he entred into the foure Elements, he <hi>Entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death,</hi> and his body became like a Beaſt; and the Earth was Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Lord, ſo that it bare no more Paradiſicall Fruit: For <hi>Adam</hi> was driven out, into the outward Principle: and there he muſt eate Earthly Fruit, and open [or manifeſt] the Wonders of the Outward Principle, and ſo he inſtantly became Earthly.</p>
                        <p n="137">137. For his Body was from the Earth, and Created out of the Earth, but it was not Earth [no more then Gold is Earth, though it groweth in the Earth, and proceedeth from the Earth] for it was <hi>Ex Matrice, ex Maſſâ;</hi> [from the Matrix, out of a Maſſe;] under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; out of the ſubſtantiality, out of which the Earth was <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> generated and created.

                        <p n="138">138. <hi>Adam</hi> would be as God in all the Three Principles; and the Serpent alſo perſwaded <hi>Eve</hi> to it; that if ſhee would Eate of the fruite of the Earth, ſhee ſhould know good and evill: indeed <hi>evill enough;</hi> care, miſery, and ſorrowes, in the Death of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

As God the Father himſelfe is <hi>All;</hi> he is the Number-Three of the Deity, he is the Majeſty, he is the ſtill Eternity; he is the Nature, and in it he is the Love and the Anger: the Anger is a cauſe of his Strength and Might; as alſo a cauſe of Life, and of all Mobility, as the Poyſon [or Gall] in Man, is: and the Love is a cauſe of the Heart of his Majeſty; and a cauſe of the Number-Three; and of the Three Principles.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. And as wee know and have mentioned before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Fire is a cauſe of the Light; for without fire there would be no Light, ſo there would be no <hi>Love</hi> without Light, the Light is Love [or pleaſantneſſe], for it is kinde and amiable, and wee ſee that the Light and the fire have <hi>two ſeverall</hi> [properties or] ſources, the <hi>fire</hi> is biting, wrathfull, devouring and conſuming: and the <hi>Light</hi> is pleaſant, ſweet, and deſirous of a Body, the Love deſireth a Body; and the fire alſo deſireth the Body for its nouriſhment, but devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it quite, and the Light<note n="c" place="margin">Vivifieth it.</note> raiſeth it up and deſireth to fill it; it taketh nothing away from the Body, but<note n="c" place="margin">Vivifieth it.</note> quickeneth it up, and maketh it friendly.</p>

Thus wee may conſider with our ſelves, <hi>whence</hi> it ariſeth that there is a wrathfull and a good will: For you ſee the Fire hath <hi>two</hi> Spirits, <hi>one</hi> is that which proceedeth from the heate, and the <hi>other</hi> that which proceedeth from the Light: Now the Heate is Nature, and the Light is the Eternall Liberty without [or beyond] Nature: for Nature comprehendeth not the Light.</p>

And ſo you muſt underſtand as concerning the <hi>two</hi> ſorts of wills in God, the <hi>one</hi> is Nature, and is not called God, and yet is Gods, for he is angry, ſevere, ſharp as a ſting, conſuming, attracting all things to himſelfe, and devouring them, alwayes ſtriving to flie up above the Light, [which is the <hi>other</hi> will], and yet cannot; as the fire doth, which the higher it flyeth, the higher goeth the Light, and ſo they may well be called <hi>two Principles.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. For it hath no Fire, though indeed it hath a mighty Fire, but it burneth in anotte ſource [or property] viz. <hi>in the deſiring;</hi> It is ſoft, delicate or pleaſant, without paine; alſo it conſumeth nothing; but its Spirit is <hi>Love and joy:</hi> its fire maketh Majeſty and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and that hath alwayes been from Eternity; it hath no ground, it hath its ſpringing up and bloſſoming, but not out of ſuch Earth as wee walke upon, and yet it is Earth, which in my whole Booke I call <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> for it is <hi>the Eternall Body,</hi> without any defect: there is no want in it, nor ſorrow, nor miſery; no ſuch thing is knowne there at all; there is no Death, Devill, nor Anger knowne in it, but <hi>ſuch things</hi> ſtand altogether in the Darkneſſe [or in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall oblivion] hidden in the firſt Principle.</p>

                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61125:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>3.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. For the Majeſty is the Light of that Body, and the Holy Ghoſt is its Aire and Spirit of Life; but the Creatures [<hi>viz.</hi> Angels and Men] have the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For wee know what he is in Death, and what he is in Life, wee know alſo what he is in Hell; and that <hi>not from our own wiſdome,</hi> (as if that were greater then any Man's Living) but [wee underſtand it] in the booſom of the Mother, in the Mothers Spirit.</p>

                     <p n="12">12.

Thus you ſee it very plainly and openly, that the life of the fire letteth goe the <hi>Aire:</hi> for it will not ſtay in the ſource [or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty] of the fire: for it flieth eagerly, and the ſource [or<note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>vertue.</hi>
                           </note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty] of the fire continually attracteth the ſame back againe into it: And ſo the Fire is <hi>blowne up,</hi> or elſe it would be ſmothered, and become dark: and for that cauſe it reacheth thus after the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, <hi>viz.</hi> after the <hi>Aire.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p n="38">38. For in the Eternity there was never any death at all, nor ſhall be ever; But that which is called <hi>the Eternall Death,</hi> is a ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the Tincture, where the Tincture goeth away like a<note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>figure.</hi>
                           </note> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſo the Centre (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſource [or fountaine] of the Fire) remaineth in the Darkneſſe, and floweth in meere wrath in it ſelfe: and would very faine <hi>reach</hi> the Tincture againe, and yet it hath no power to doe ſo, for the <hi>Tincture</hi> onely is the power, which bloweth up the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. Conſider heere what Hell and the Eternall Death is, for it is juſt ſo; and know, that the Devills have <hi>loſt the Tincture of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> who now are a wrathfull fire-ſource without ſubſtantiality, for they have no <hi>Body.</hi>

Secondly, Conſider alſo the Element of Water; and as you know that it hath its originall in the ſpirit of the Creature; ſo alſo it hath its originall in the Deepe of the World, which is alſo a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and hath ſuch a life as other Creatures have.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. And Thirdly, Conſider, that there are <hi>two ſorts of Fires,</hi> a Hot and a Cold: for as the Heate<note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</hi>
                           </note> contracteth together, ſo doth the Cold, which turneth Water into Ice, and maketh a<note n="a" place="margin">Heterogene body.</note> ſtrange body out of the Subſtantiality [or Water] which is not its owne.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. By this wee give you dearly to underſtand, <hi>the Fall of Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> who thus reached into the Centre of Nature into the harſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix and awakened it, ſo that it <hi>concreted</hi> the Subſtantiality, and ſo Earth and Stones came to be.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. You will ſay, Why did God ſuffer<note n="b" place="margin">The fall of Lucifer.</note> it? [The Anſwer is:]
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61125:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> He was a Prince and Throne-Angell, and was created with <hi>the firſt Creation:</hi> and therefore ſince he was a cauſe of the Third Principle, (underſtand, of the Out-Birth,) therefore Chriſt called him alſo a Prince of this World; for he had alſo a <hi>Free will,</hi> like us Men. Wee oftentimes<note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>make.</hi>
                           </note> doe workes which are contrary to God, onely for our State and Honour, as is ſeene in Forts, Caſtles, and<note n="*" place="margin">Pallaces.</note> Sumptuous Great Houſes.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. So Lucifer alſo would be as a God and Creator, <hi>all which might have been well enough,</hi> for that was <hi>not</hi> his Fall, [no more then it was <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, that he Imagined, whereupon God ſuffered the Tree of Temptation to Grow] but it was his Fall, that he <hi>awakened</hi> the Matrix of the Fire, and would <hi>domineere over the Meekneſſe</hi> of the Heart of God.</p>
                        <p n="45">45. That [awakened Matrix of the Fire] is now his <hi>Hell:</hi> and God hath captivated that Hell, with the Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Matrix of the Water. For [Lucifer would faine that] the Place of this World<note n="d" place="margin">For the place of this world would have burnt in the Fire for Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> 
                           <hi>ſhould burne</hi> in the Fire for him [to domineere in]: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God moved himſelfe to the Creation, and did create; and ſo there was <hi>Water,</hi> which captivated his wrathfull Hell [as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Sunne ſhutteth up the Aſtringent Cold, and turneth Ice into Water, whereby Fiſhes and other Creatures grow and Live].</p>
                        <p n="46">46. And the Cauſe of the Sea and of the Great Deepe Waters, whoſe bottom cannot be fathomed, is, that the <hi>Matrix</hi> of Nature was in<note n="e" place="margin">Where the Great Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are.</note> 
                           <hi>thoſe places</hi> ſo far enkindled in the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. And heere wee give you an Example of this. Conſider <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> when their ſinnes became Great, and that the Devill dwelt there: and would have a Kingdome there for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, God permitted, that the Prince of this world ſhould burne thoſe five Kingdomes (wherein the Devill intended to dwell) <hi>with fire and Brimſtone.</hi> But when the Devill thought to be Lord, and to have his Habitation there; then God <hi>brake</hi> his Pride and Stoutneſſe: and cauſed <hi>Water</hi> to come upon that Place, and alayed his Pride.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. And in this wee have an Excellent Example, of Gods care for his children which depend on him: for when he ſaw the<note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> that the Anger was kindled.</note> Wrath, <hi>he brought forth</hi> Lot <hi>out of</hi> Sodom. And further you have heerein a full Example, that when the Wrath of God beginneth to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he maketh it <hi>knowne</hi> to his Children before hand, that they might flie from it, as he told it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to flie from it; and ſo he hath done from the beginning of the World. For, the Prophets were for no other end, but to <hi>declare the Anger of God,</hi> and to command the children of God to flie from it; as may be ſeene by what was done to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and hath been alwayes done to <hi>all People</hi> from the beginning of the world to this Time. [For when no Puniſhments or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61125:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> more can be expected, then Prophecying ſhall ceaſe].</p>
                        <p n="49">49. Therefore let none blindfold themſelves,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but conſider what ſuch a <hi>Warning</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> ſignifieth, which at preſent is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the World. This is the Time of the overthrow of the Dragon, with the Whore of <hi>Babell,</hi> which ſhall goe downe into the Abyſſe. Now he that will not flie, yet let him have warning of it. He that will bring the Whores marks forth into the Light, will have great ignominy and reproach by it, wee ſpeake what wee ought: the Day dawneth <hi>the Sun will ſuddenly ariſe,</hi> account it not for a Fiction, it is concluded and knowne <hi>in Ternario Sancto;</hi> Looke into the Scripture in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which the Sophiſters had rather it were caſt out of the Bible; but the underſtanding of it will ſoone <hi>bud forth:</hi> and then the <hi>Pedlers</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and of the <hi>Whore</hi> will ſtand in great ſhame; and none will buy their ware any more. <hi>No ſword</hi> deſtroyeth the Whore, but her own Mouth choaketh her; for there are nothing but Lyes and Blaſphemies in it, and yet ſhee ſeemeth as if ſhee were God. Therefore ſay wee, let every one looke to his own Doing: lift up your heads, as Chriſt ſaith; for <hi>the time of your Redemption draweth neere;</hi> you are baptized with water; but he that will baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with the Fire of his Wrath, <hi>is already on his way;</hi> be not wilfully blinde.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. Thus underſtand us right concerning the Life of Man, as wee have now mentioned: This laſt forementioned Life, is<note n="g" place="margin">Solely, or alone.</note> 
                           <hi>ſingly</hi> in the Beaſts, for it hath its Originall onely in the Principle of this world, in the <hi>Matrix</hi> of Nature, which is every where ſuch a Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rit, and ſuch a Life in it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. And in Man, the life is <hi>twofold:</hi> for Man hath alſo the life of this [outward] Principle in him: but he deſireth alſo another life, which is higher and better then this.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. And now where there is a Deſire, there is a Mother, who is the Deſire it ſelfe; for no Deſire can make it ſelfe, it muſt ariſe out of a will, and the will muſt come out of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> which is the Life of the Will.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. Thus wee know and have ſearched out, that in the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Principle of this world, <hi>viz.</hi> in the life of this World, there is alſo <hi>another Tincture,</hi> which wee have an apprehenſion of, in our ſelves. If there were not <hi>another Tincture,</hi> the Life would deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. Yet wee cannot ſay, that the outward Life deſireth any thing more: it deſireth nothing elſe but its own Mother, <hi>viz.</hi> the Principle of this world. For it is onely a Spirit therein, for no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple deſireth another, a Principle is a peculiar life, and hath its Centre to Nature; and <hi>therefore wee call it</hi> a Principle, becauſe there is a <hi>Totall</hi> Dominion in it, as there is in the Eternity; which Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61125:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> deſireth nothing more nor higher, but onely that which may be generated in its own Centre; as you may eaſily perceive it by the Kingdome of Heaven and the Kingdome of Hell; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven deſireth nothing but the Divine Beeing: but Hell [deſireth] that which is wrathfull, murtherous, fiery, ſoure, ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Aſtringent, and whatſoever is in the Property of Anger in the Fire</p>
                        <p n="55">55. Now there being in us, a deſire after the higheſt Good, and after <hi>the Eternity:</hi> that deſire muſt needs proceed out of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and higheſt Will, out of the higheſt Beeing, and its life is alſo out of the <hi>higheſt Tincture:</hi> for where there is a Deſire, there is Fire; for the Fire deſireth ſubſtantiality, that it may have whereon to feede, and yet it ſelfe can make no ſubſtantiality, but <hi>it maketh the Tincture,</hi> and the Tincture maketh the ſubſtantiality, as is above-mentioned.</p>
                        <p n="56">56. Now <hi>the Tincture is a Creature,</hi> for it hath a Body [as may be ſeene in the Tincture (or colour) of Gold]; though it be not palpable, yet it is<note n="h" place="margin">Eſſentiall.</note> ſubſtantiall; and the underſtanding is in the Tincture, for it is a wreſtling with the Fire, and flieth before the Fire, and yet cannot flie away; becauſe the Fire<note n="i" place="margin">Deſireth.</note> generateth it, and continually attracteth it againe into it ſelfe, and it ſtill <hi>ſtriveth</hi> to get out from the fire with the ſubſtantiality, and is after the manner, as a Man fetcheth Breath.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. Therefore wee give you now rightly to underſtand it thus: you ſee that the Tincture ſhineth, and in the ſhining, there is no ſtirring, but a conſtant Luſtre; and yet in the Luſtre there is <hi>all power,</hi> as in the <hi>Tincture:</hi> and it is an Eternall Stillneſſe, and the Tincture is the ſtirring, and alſo the life. Underſtand us rightly and deeply, for it is the deepeſt Ground, and <hi>foundation</hi> in Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="58">58. The other Deſire in Man after the Higheſt Good, is the <hi>ſoule;</hi> which ſtandeth in the Eternall Mother: for every deſire hath its originall out of its own Mother: therefore this is a deſire of the Eternity; and not the Eternity [it ſelfe] but the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Eternity, and the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> viz. the glance in the Still Habitation; as is now mentioned.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. Now if a Spirit be in its own Mother, it deſireth not to goe out from her againe: [as the Aire-ſpirit doth not deſire to goe away from the Body]: neither doth it deſire <hi>any thing more</hi> then what is in its Mother, and in its Centre.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. But yet wee finde and underſtand it in our minde, that the ſoule willeth to be out of this <hi>[Earthly] Mother,</hi> in which it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at preſent: and not onely ſo; [but] it deſireth the <hi>houſe</hi> of its own Mother, <hi>viz.</hi> its own Tincture, and the Majeſty, alſo the Eternall Reſt out of the Tincture.</p>
                        <p n="61">
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61125:65"/>61. And ſo wee ſearch and finde, and have it in true knowledge; that the poore ſoule in the Spirit and in the Tincture [or life] of this [outward] world, <hi>lyeth captive</hi> in a ſtrange Lodging, and hath not its Light of the Majeſty, for if it had that, it would be at Reſt and deſire nothing more.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. Alſo wee finde, that it lyeth captive <hi>in Death</hi> in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for if it had its [right] Tincture, then ſhould the Majeſty wherein it is a childe of God, <hi>ſhine in it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="63">63. Therefore wee ſay, that the poore <hi>ſoule of Adam</hi> was captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit and Principle of this world: and received the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of this world into it? and then Inſtantly the Majeſty &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God remained ſtanding in its [own] Principle: for the ſoule put its will and deſire into the Spirit of this world, and <hi>it ſelfe entered into it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="64">64. Thus God ſhut up the Heaven in the ſoule, ſo that it knew its Majeſty no more; and there was <hi>perplexity</hi> and great miſery, that an Eternall Creature ſhould come to be in another Principle in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Centre. Heere the ſeaven Seales to the Book of the Eternall Life were <hi>ſhut to the ſoule,</hi> for the <hi>Centre</hi> of its life was ſhut up and captivated in the Eternall Death, it could no more ſtirre any forme in the Centre of its Life, <hi>it lay in Hell like</hi>
                           <note n="k" place="margin">As a dead Corpſe in the Grave.</note> 
                           <hi>dead Bones,</hi> the Dragon had it in his Jawes.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. For it was in the houſe of miſery, there was none that could help it, no Angel, no Throne-Prince, no Creature, neither could the <hi>Centre of the ſoule</hi> help it: for its fire was extinguiſhed, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world had ſwallowed it up [as the water devoureth the brightneſſe of the flaming Iron]: for the Will of the ſoule was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Spirit [of this world], and had married [or joyned] it ſelfe thereto,<note n="l" place="margin">The Will.</note> it was in <hi>another Mother,</hi> as it is now at this Day.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. And ſo now if the Mother of this world had been broken (as it doth breake [indeed]) then the ſoule <hi>ſhould have ſtood</hi> in the Eternall Death in the Darkneſſe. Heere<note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Remedy.</hi>
                           </note> Counſell was at an end, the faire Creature was captivated <hi>by the Kingdome of Hell,</hi> which tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over it.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The highly Precious Gate.</head>
                        <p n="67">67. Heere was no Counſell in the <hi>whole Deity, unleſſe</hi> the Eternall Word and Heart of God <hi>did become Man,</hi> and did enter into the Third Principle into humane fleſh and bloud, and aſſume a humane Soule, and goe into Death to the poore ſoule, and did take away the Power of Death (which held the ſoule captive) and the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſting of Hell, which it had ſtuck into the ſoule: and did leade the poore ſoule out of Death, and out of Hell,<note n="n" place="margin">In, by, or through.</note> 
                           <hi>in himſelfe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="68">
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61125:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>68. And heere wee ſee, that after the Word did become Man that Man ſuffered himſelfe to be hanged on the Croſſe, and entred into Death on the Croſſe: underſtand heere, <hi>the New Living Man borne of God,</hi> went into the Abyſſe and brake Death in the ſoule, and opened the Centre of the ſoule: Hee <hi>brake all the ſeaven Seales</hi> of the Centre of Nature, ſo that the ſoule came to have its owne power againe, for he <hi>kindled the Divine fire</hi> in the ſoule againe, ſo that the ſoule did againe reach the Eternall Tincture <hi>out of</hi> its own fire.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. And thus it came againe into its firſt Mother, in power and Majeſty: and <hi>the Old Adam</hi> hung to the Croſſe as <hi>Curſe:</hi> to the ſcorne of all Devills, there they might doe ſo far as they could with it, as indeed they were buſie with the Sophiſters and Antichriſts, the Phariſees.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. There the Devills ran with other ſuttlety and <hi>Tricks</hi> into<note n="o" place="margin">Corners and ſecret places.</note> holes, and did hide [cover and conceale] <hi>the Reſurrection,</hi> through the Miniſters of the Dragon, the Phariſees, which yet pretend to be the Miniſters of God? but they ſerved the Devill <hi>in his lyes,</hi> as is done now adayes, where the Death and power of Chriſt is cloſed up and <hi>denyed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="71">71. This hanging on the Croſſe is nothing elſe, but that as the ſoule hath its originall upon the Croſſe in the Centre of Nature, (out of the Word of the Lord, <hi>ex verbo Domini,</hi>) where the <hi>Name</hi> of the Number Three <hi>ſtandeth.</hi> There hath the Word of the Father moved it ſelfe; and is entred into the <hi>Humanity;</hi> as is heeretofore mentioned concerning the Virgin, and is become Man on the Croſſe, in the Eternall and in the Earthly Virgin: and hath been made <hi>a ſpectacle</hi> on the Croſſe, to the Old Adamicall Man and all Devills, and their lofty Pride; and hath ſlaine Death on the Croſſe: and thereby broken through it, and ſo brought the Adamicall Man (with fleſh and bloud) as <hi>a ſpectacle</hi> into Death: and hath caſt away from him all Earthlineſſe, and brought <hi>him powerfully</hi> through Death into Life.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. Thus he is new Borne in God: and ſitteth upon the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, on the Subſtantiality and Colours of the Eternity, in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Majeſty, and is a Lord of Heaven and of this world, and a Judge of Hell, and a<note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>Power.</hi>
                           </note> Conqueſt over Death.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. Of this you have a true Gound, yee that are Regenerated in Chriſt: that as Chriſt brought his body, both the Heavenly and the Earthly, (which he received in his Mother <hi>Mary</hi>), out from Death againe: and did caſt away from him nothing elſe but the Earthly ſource [or property] viz. <hi>the Spirit of this [outward] world.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="74">74. So alſo muſt our Bodies in the power of the ſoules that are in him (that is, in his Word and Heart, <hi>which is every where,</hi>) come

                        <p n="75">75.

Therefore now when wee conſider the Dominion [or <hi>Courſe</hi>] of our Life, we finde a <hi>powerfull ſtrife</hi> therein, which the Devill hath with the ſoule: and alſo which the Spirit of this world hath with the ſoule. For there is a knowledge in the ſpirit of this world, indeed there is <hi>no divine underſtanding</hi> in it, but there is an apprehenſion planted in the Matrix, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Centre of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p n="7">7. And ſo there is a naturall ſtrife with man therein, for no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>but Man,</hi> can bring the Wonders of the world to light; and therefore alſo the Spirit of this world hath ſo very much longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Man, and hath drawne him <hi>to it,</hi> that it might ſhew forth its Wonders in him, that Man ſhould produce all Arts and Languages in<note n="x" place="margin">The Spirit of this world.</note> it, Moreover the Spirit and Heart out of Earths and Mettalls, <hi>viz:</hi> that Precious Stone, <hi>the Philoſophers Stones,</hi> which indeed ſince <hi>Salomons Time,</hi> hath been found by few; but now at the End <hi>ſhall be found</hi> more cleerly, as wee know and underſtand.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. And wee declare unto you, that the Spirit of this world is created with ſuch an inclination, and that it hath a naturall will to reveale it ſelfe and all its <hi>Myſteries,</hi> as wee ſee before our eyes by what it hath built or brought forth, how it hath erected a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Kingdome upon Earth.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Doe but looke upon the <hi>doings</hi> of Man, from the higheſt to the loweſt: the Spirit of this world hath thus built the <hi>whole</hi>

                     <p n="11">11. But you muſt underſtand it aright, Hell and the Anger are the <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> which mingleth its wonders alſo therein, as we ſee where there is good<note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſoyle.</hi>

You are to know, that all weeds, as Thiſtles and Thornes, alſo Serpents, Toads, evill Beaſts and Wormes, have their originall from the <hi>Wrathfull Matrix;</hi> For in the time of the Creation, all both good and evill came forth, every thing according to its kinde and property: there is good and evill in every thing, and the Kingdome of Anger hath alſo wholly<note n="a" place="margin">

                        <hi>imprinted</hi> it ſelfe therein, and <hi>therefore</hi> the fruit is Good and Evill, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not have eaten thereof.</p>
                     <p n="13">13.

And you are to know, that the Kingdome of Anger did alſo <hi>preſſe</hi> into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which brought forth a Tree, that did beare ſuch fruit, as all the Trees are now adayes which wee feed upon.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Onely wee are to conſider, that the fruits for Man doe not grow of themſelves, he muſt <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>dreſſe</hi> them, as you ſee in all Trees, both in the wood and ſtalks of them: and Man deſireth not willingly [to eate of] the <hi>[firſt] Eſſences</hi> of the Earth; except it be a very<note n="b" place="margin">Milde or ſweete.</note> pleaſant <hi>hearb,</hi> but he deſireth the <hi>ſecond Birth</hi> out of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>kernell</hi> [ſeede or fruit], which is indeed the ſecond Birth out of the Earth, whereby wee underſtand our high diſcent, but before the Fall Paradiſe <hi>ſprung up</hi> through all Trees, and through all the fruits which God created for Man.</p>
                     <p n="16">16.

                        <p n="17">17. There is a great Strife about Mans Image, each Kingdome would have it: <hi>Hell</hi> in the Anger ſaith; it is mine by the right of Nature, it is generated out of my Roote. Alſo the <hi>Spirit of the world</hi> ſaith; I have it in my body, and I give it life and nouriſhment, I bring it up, and give it all my powers and wonders, it is mine. And <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> ſaith alſo; I have ſet my heart upon it, and have regenerated it: it is proceeded out of my Kingdome: I have ſought and found it againe: it is mine, it muſt reveale my Wonders.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Thus there is a vehement Strife in and about Man: looke upon his Converſation and <hi>Doings;</hi> his deſire ſtandeth eſpecially in <hi>Three Things,</hi> and they are Three Kingdomes which Rule him: and into which of them he falleth, there he lyeth.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he deſireth power, honour, and glory, that all might feare and honour him: this is even the Poyſon of the Devill, who hath alſo ſuch an intention, which he ſatisfieth by doing as much as he can.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he deſireth riches, goods, and money, much eating and drinking, and careth not by what meanes he cometh by it; it is the Spirit of this world, which deſireth onely ſhelter and fulneſſe, as a Beaſt doth.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> he deſireth the Kingdome of Heaven alſo, he deſireth and panteth after that: but in much weakneſſe, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in doubt [thinking] he is a Sinner; [and that] God deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to have him: yet he ſigheth and panteth after it, and would ſame be ſaved: he prayeth and yet doubteth, he hopeth and yet feareth, he <hi>hopeth</hi> for amendment and <hi>deliverance</hi> from one day to another, and alwayes ſuppoſeth, it will be well to morrow, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thou wilt have power to goe from this [courſe of] life and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into another: thus it is alwayes with him.</p>
                        <p n="22">22.

                        <p n="23">23. Yet obſerve what Man doth: he <hi>followeth</hi> all theſe three [deſires], he continually ſeeketh power and honour till his end, he continually hunts after <hi>covetouſneſſe, money, and goods,</hi> to eate and drink; and though he have ſuperfluity, yet in his covetouſneſſe, he hath not enough; he doth as if he were to live heere for ever; and then <hi>thirdly,</hi> he alſo <hi>panteth</hi> [after the Kingdome of <hi>Heaven</hi>] for the poore ſoule is very much perplexed, and is ever <hi>afraid</hi> to the

They ſay, The Devill cometh to Man, in the forme of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and it is true: Obſerve what he doth, that he is accounted an Angel, and is accounted good; when the poore ſoule is thus <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,</hi> and many times preſenteth to the Body, Death and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God: he hindereth not that; he often lets the poore ſoule runne with the Body to the Houſes of Stone, [to the Churches] or whither it will: <hi>he puts it on</hi> moſt willingly of all to goe to the <hi>Stone Churches,</hi> and there ſaith to the ſoule; Now thou art Godly and Devout, thou goeſt diligently to Church.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. But what doth he then? when any teach of the Temple of Chriſt, and of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> then he ſoweth other Thoughts into the Spirit of this world, in Man; Sometimes <hi>Covetouſneſſe;</hi> ſometimes he ſets the Eyes upon <hi>Pride,</hi> State, and Beauty; ſometimes he cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Spirit with the <hi>Luſt</hi> &amp; Imagination towards Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according to their ſex, and tickleth the Heart with wanton Luſt; ſometimes they are lulled faſt <hi>aſleepe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="26">26. But when the Preacher is a <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> and a malicious ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, or rayler: or perhaps many times in performance of his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and from a good meaning, rebuketh men according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. <hi>There</hi> the Devill ſets open every Doore and Gate, and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Hearts [of the Hearers] therewith; and the Heart wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill more and more of that, that is <hi>very fine</hi> [to keepe them from falling aſleepe].</p>
                        <p n="27">27. And when ſuch people goe from Church, they can <hi>repeate</hi> every word <hi>very readily,</hi> and that beſt of all which tends to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of others: with that they feaſt themſelves the whole weeke long; it is <hi>more acceptable</hi> to them then the Word of God.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. Behold, this is a Devill in an Angelicall forme: when they ſuppoſe that if they doe but run to Church together, ſuch a one is a <hi>very good</hi> Chriſtian. But if they have learnt no more but to ſcorne, mock, and deride others, and bring it <hi>home</hi> to their families, it had been better they had all that time been wallowing in the mire, or that they had been faſt aſleepe, and then the Devill ſhould not have defiled their ſoules in the <hi>Church</hi> of ſtone, <hi>with wantonneſſe and ſcorne:</hi> O how happy a ſleepe it is in the Church, when the Preacher invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61125:69"/> the Devill into the Heart for a Gueſt; it is better to ſleepe, then to Imagine wantonneſſe, or to fill the heart with revilings and ſcorne.</p>
                        <p n="29">29.

                        <p n="32">32. Thus the Heart ſtandeth and repeateth over the words of a Prayer, as if it were learning ſomewhat without Booke; and the Devill taketh away the vertue &amp; efficacy of them out of the Heart, ſo that the ſoule cannot reach the Centre of Nature: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Devill taketh the Word out of your hearts, that you may not beleeve and be ſaved.</hi>

                        <p n="41">41. For when a Man that is Regenerated in God, ſo that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Light, beginneth to ſearch out <hi>his originall,</hi> then the Spirit of the ſoule ſearcheth in all the Three Principles, what<note n="m" place="margin">It.</note> he is in each of them; for wee know it, and cannot ſay otherwiſe, then that wee, in the Image of the Spirit, and alſo of the Body, in all the Three Principles, have but one onely <hi>rule</hi> [or <hi>Dominion</hi>] in us; but that Dominion is in three Sources [or qualities]: the Spirit and the Body is driven according to <hi>each</hi> Principle, and what Principle it is which getteth the upper hand in Man, ſo that Man with his will inclineth to it, according to that <hi>he performeth his work,</hi> and the other [Principles] doe but cleave to it, not having ſufficient power.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. But when wee will ſpeake of the Image, wee muſt ſee what it is in the Ground thereof. For wee are ſowne as a ſeede in a field, into the<note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>womb.</hi>

Behold, in the Eternity all hath been in one Beeing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Tincture,</hi> which is the Centre and cauſe of Life, as hath been mentioned at large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; alſo the <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> which is generated out of the Tincture, which hath alſo all the formes of the Centre, yet without Fire, for<note n="o" place="margin">The Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</note> it is a ſincking downe, and cannot kindle the Life in it, it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall and affordeth Body; but not Life, for the fire affordeth life.</p>
                        <p n="44">44.

The Body of the Tincture had in it the Centre of the Life: and the Body of the Subſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had not the Centre to the Striking up of the Fire: indeed it had the life, but<note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> faint, weake.</note> an unpotent life.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. This wee demonſtrate thus that you may rightly underſtand it: look upon a<note n="u" place="margin">Red hot.</note> flaming Iron, which ſendeth two ſpirits forth from it ſelfe, one <hi>hot</hi> one, which hath the Centre, and can kindle and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken another fire: and one <hi>Airey</hi> one, from which water proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which hath alſo all Powers of the Fire; yet the Tincture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not fire, but it is an Eternall Barre, that no fire can be therein, and yet is the Spirit of the Fire, which hath its ſource out of the Fire, and its life like to the Fire, for in the <hi>Eternity</hi> there is no Death. Therefore in the female kinde, no life can proceed out of their Tinctures, but the Matrix muſt get the Tincture from the ſeede of the Male.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. Thus wee declare unto you alſo the <hi>Ground</hi> of the difference between the Male and the Female kinde: for when God created the <hi>Materiall Subſtance,</hi> there went forth <hi>the kindes</hi> of all Eſſences in the Centre of Nature, according to all the Properties: for as you ſee the Starres, that one hath a property different from the other, which all, are created out of <hi>the Centre of Nature,</hi> according to the Materiall Subſtantiality, and ſo all Eſſences ſtood in the Materiall Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and the <hi>Fiat</hi> attracted all towards the Created Earth.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. And there hath every forme of the Tincture, and of the Spirit of the ſeverall kindes, <hi>figured</hi> every one its own body, according to its Properties, as to be Beaſts, Fowles, Wormes, Fiſhes, Trees and Hearbs, alſo to be Metalls and Earth, all according as the life was in them. And this you may well perceive by the difference of each Dayes work [of the Creation].</p>
                        <p n="50">50. For on the firſt Day, <hi>God Created the Materiall Water,</hi> (which hath an unpotent and life, and is a Barre upon the fire of the Anger,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61125:71"/> and upon the Devils ſmoaky Pit, where he thought in the burning fire to domineere over God,) Alſo [he then created] <hi>the Earth and Stones,</hi> and ſo the<note n="x" place="margin">Droſſe.</note> Groſſe part was ſevered, which conſiſted in mortall and fierce Eſſences, whereby <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſuppoſed to be King and Creator <hi>therein.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="51">51. When this was done, God ſaid; <hi>Let there be light</hi> (let the Light of the Tincture open it ſelfe) <hi>and there was Light: then God ſeperated the Light from the Darkneſſe.</hi> Underſtand this rightly. Hee [God] ſhut up the fierce fire which Lucifer had kindled (which ſourceth out of the Darkneſſe) and let the Tincture in the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence</hi> burne, as in the fat of the Water-Spirit, as in a Beaſt [the fire of its life burneth].</p>
                        <p n="52">52. Thus the life did burne in the Tincture, and turned the fat, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Oyle,</hi> into a Quinteſſence, viz. <hi>Bloud,</hi> and ſo that life did burne in the Bloud; for therein ſtandeth the Noble <hi>Tincture:</hi> and God hath reſerved in his own power <hi>the Centre</hi> of the Fire: for he hath ſhut it up in the Darkneſſe, as it hath ſtood from Eternity in the Darkneſſe: and ſo every Life ſtandeth <hi>in his hand:</hi> for if he let the fire <hi>come into</hi> the Tincture, then the Spirit is in the <hi>helliſh</hi> Fire.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. Now when the light did ſhine out of the Tincture, he <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> the Tincture into <hi>two</hi> parts, even as it divideth it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Fire-Life, and into the Light-Life: as was mentioned in the laſt foregoing leafe, and created the two lives, the fire-life to be a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a firmament between the Holy Meekneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart of God: and the unpotent Aire-Spirit: and yet the Aire goeth forth from its Mother the Tincture of the Fire-ſpirit, and God dwelleth <hi>between them both.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="54">54. The Fire-ſpirit of the Tincture, hath the Eternity<note n="y" place="margin">for.</note> in its Roote, and the Aire-Spirit hath the materiall life, which ſourced forth with the awakened Subſtantiality, and ruleth the outward Beaſtiall Life: for it is the Beaſtiall life of every Creature, alſo [it is the life] of Trees, Hearbs and Graſſe, it hath alſo a Tincture, <hi>but not ſtrong enough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="55">55. Thus you ſee, how the Life ſtandeth in the Water, and hath two Dominions, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, and Aire, and you ſee whence the <hi>Bloud</hi> hath its originall, which maketh a Creature [that hath bloud] <hi>more Noble,</hi> then one that hath not bloud in it, for that Creature hath a falſe Tincture, and is proceeded from the Will of the Devill as you ſee in Vipours and venemous Wormes, they have <hi>not</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tincture [or the Noble Life].</p>
                        <p n="56">56. But when the Devill intended to be Lord in the Tincture, and would Create, he awakened <hi>ſuch a life</hi> in his will, which yet is not <hi>all</hi> his [life] he is indeed of the ſame Eſſences, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61125:72"/> Bodies are figured alſo in Hell into ſuch Serpents, venemous Wormes, and<note n="z" place="margin">Loathſome, deformed.</note> ugly Beaſts: for they cannot in their own forme be otherwiſe; although indeed they have not a Body from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Tincture from its Subſtantiality, but [they have a body] out of the Centre of Nature: out of the fierce <hi>Matrix,</hi> out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Subſtantiality, out of the Darkneſſe, which is <hi>a Spirituall Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="57">57. Now when God had Created the Earth, <hi>the water was over the whole Earth, which God ſeperated, that the Earth became dry, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Water Sea,</hi> Méér, which in the Language of Nature, ſignifieth a covering, and holding faſt the fierceneſſe of the Devill, a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Devill, that his power was drowned, to expound this, very acute Writings are requiſite, and<note n="a" place="margin">The naturall Man.</note> Man could hardly be able to apprehend it.</p>
                        <p n="58">58. Thus the Earth ſprung<note n="b" place="margin">Put forth its own vertue.</note> in its <hi>own</hi> Eſſences and Tincture, which were alſo<note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>conceived.</hi>
                           </note> comprehended in the Firſt Creation.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. It ſhall alſo be rightly expounded to you, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith: <hi>God ſeperated the Water above the Firmament from the Water beneath the Firmament;</hi> that is, into the Water and Bloud of the [living] Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the water above the Firmament, is Bloud, and therein ſtandeth the<note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>life.</hi>
                           </note> Tincture, which ſeperateth the Heaven from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beneath the Firmament, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Elementary water; as wee ſee that each of them hath its own habitation and Dominion: of which may be ſpoken more at large in another place.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. Only wee underſtand therein two Kingdomes, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoule dwelleth in the Bloud in the Tincture, and in the water dwelleth the Aire-Spirit, which is <hi>corruptible:</hi> for it had a beginning, but the ſoule had none; for the Tincture is from Eternity, and therefore <hi>the figures of all kindes</hi> muſt remaine in <hi>Eternity,</hi> account it not for an opinion, it is really ſo.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. Now when Heaven, Earth, and the Elements were thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then the fiery Tincture was as a ſhining Light, and was a Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, called Heaven: for this world had <hi>no other Light:</hi> And then God ſuffered the Centre of Nature to open it ſelfe in the Created Subſtantiality: (For this whole Principle became but one body) and there brake forth its Heart [<hi>viz.</hi> the Heart of this Principle] with its own proper will and<note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſenſes.</hi>
                           </note> faculties out of the Eſſences; that is the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Starres</hi> are its Eſſences, and the <hi>ſix</hi> Planets are the Spirits at the Centre of the Heart; and the Sun is their Heart: all juſt as the Deity hath been from Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. Thus there came a true life and underſtanding, with reaſon and<note n="f" place="margin">Senſes.</note> perception, yet a Beaſtiall one, into the outward Tincture and the<note n="g" place="margin">

                        <p n="71">71. You may well perceive what wee ſet before you, thus; The <hi>Zodiack</hi> with the Conſtellations belong to the Minde, as well in the Deepe of the World, as alſo in the Creature, the <hi>Twelve Signes</hi> are the twelve parts which the Croſſe in the Centre maketh; from which the Upper Dominion is divided into twelve Parts, as alſo the Minde is; For the <hi>ſix Formes</hi> in the Centre beſides <hi>Sol,</hi> doe each of them divide themſelves into two Parts ([<hi>Sol</hi> divideth not it ſelfe but onely into <hi>the Number Three,</hi> or into the ſplendour fire and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture]) <hi>one</hi> according to the Tincture that hath Life [in it], the <hi>other</hi> according to the Tincture of the Aire, which hath ſpirit [in it] and yet maketh no Life.</p>
                        <p n="72">72.

                        <p n="80">80.

                        <p n="81">81. For that which will<note n="c" place="margin">Snatch.</note> catch hold of God muſt paſſe through the Fire: for no ſubſtantiality reacheth God, unleſſe it ſubſiſt in the Fire, underſtand, in a <hi>peculiar</hi> Fire: if that ſhould kindle, the world would melt away: Wee meane not the Fire of the Out-Birth, which is no Fire, but onely a ſharp fierceneſſe, which conſumeth the outward Subſtantiality which ſpringeth from the water, <hi>viz. Wood and Fleſh,</hi> but doth not ſtirre the Inward Fire in Stone.</p>
                        <p n="82">82. Therefore obſerve it; the Liberty<note n="d" place="margin">Extra.</note> without the Nature of this world, is onely the Eternity <hi>without ſubſtance.</hi> Now as the Eternall Centre generateth it ſelfe out of the Deſiring of the Eternall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as is mentioned before; ſo hath alſo the other Centre of the Third Principle, (through the Word <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Out-birth, out of the Eternall,) generated it ſelfe [in like manner].</p>

                           <hi>Mercurie:</hi> for the wheele is alwaies winding about, and Mercurie is a ſtirrer, a maker of a ſound &amp; a noyce, and yet hath not the life, for<note n="k" place="margin">The Life.</note> that exiſteth in the Fire; and therefore it deſireth the fierce ſtormy Turbulency, which ſtriketh up the Fire; and that about on the wheele is<note n="l" place="margin">3. ♂.

But now the Foure Formes cannot ſubſiſt in the Fire: for they have Subſtantiality, and the Fire deſireth Subſtantiality, (for the Fire it ſelfe ſubſiſteth not, if it have not fuell to feed upon) which Subſtantiality deſireth Meekneſſe, and that about on the wheele is<note n="m" place="margin">5. ♀ Venus.</note> 
                           <hi>Venus:</hi> for it is the Meakneſſe of the outward Nature, and maketh Love; for it is that which the other five Formes deſire: for every Forme windeth it ſelfe inwards and deſireth the Liberty of God, which is meeke ſtillneſſe, and as <hi>nothing,</hi> and yet is <hi>All:</hi> and if they have the Meekneſſe, which alſo maketh water [to be], then the water is Thick, and is like a duskineſſe which deſireth Light, and becometh pregnant with it, ſo that the Meekneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Venus hath a luſtre of its own above all the Starres in the Firmament; for the deſiring catcheth the Light.</p>
                        <p n="88">88. Now the Light is without ſubſtance, and only ſtill and meek, which deſireth life and ſpirit, and yet can produce no life nor ſpirit our of the Water and Meekneſſe: therefore Venus deſireth with its Meekneſſe and Light, the Heart; that is, the power and vertue of all Formes, and ſo it catcheth the Heart, which about on the wheele, in the Point, is the<note n="n" place="margin">4. ☉.

                        <p n="91">91. Thus all the ſix formes of the Heart receive the vertue of the Sun: for it penetrateth mightily into all the ſix Formes, and ſeeketh reſt and eaſe, and if it finde not that, then it preſſeth in it ſelfe forth from it ſelfe through the Fire, and deſireth <hi>the Eternall Liberty,</hi> and attaineth the Liberty through deſiring, and yet cannot be Free, for the ſharpneſſe of the Fire is in its deſiring.

                        <p n="41">41. You muſt underſtand it, thus; <hi>Adam</hi> hath left it us for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: if he had continued in the will of God; the Anger, had <hi>not touched</hi> him, to Eternity; and then the Devill had been ſhut up in the Wrath: and therefore he hath wreſtled with Man, and throwne him into ſinne, ſo that he hath awakened the Anger in the ſpirit of this world, in which the Devill is <hi>the Great Prince,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth his Kingdome with the Soules of Men: and thus <hi>the Devill is a Prince of this world:</hi> or elſe he could not touch a flie, or move a leafe, if Man had not kindled the property [and working] of the Anger: even as he is <hi>altogether voyde</hi> of ſtrength, in a time when Men are vertuous and honeſt: and therefore he driveth men ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly to <hi>unchaſtity,</hi> for he knoweth well what he getteth by that, and what abilitie it hath in the Incarnation [or Mens coming to be] and what fine ſpirit is begotten out of a falſe will [and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity</hi>], to which [Spirit] he hath a Great acceſſe and Power.</p>

                        <p n="44">44. But a falſe <hi>wicked ſoule</hi> careth not for righteouſneſſe: if it can but cover its ſinne, then it is well enough; it ſeeketh meerly to <hi>deceive,</hi> under an outward appearance, which it carrieth about in the hypocriticall ſpirit of this world: its <hi>holineſſe</hi> is a meere outward ſhew, and it knoweth not the will of God at all: but it ſuppoſeth the will of God conſiſteth in <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> but the Ceremonies are<note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>in.</hi>

                     <p n="47">47. Now the ſoule is generated only out of the <hi>firſt two,</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> is breathed into it: not that it ſhould enter into it, and give up it ſelfe thereto, as <hi>Adam</hi> hath done, but that the ſoule ſhould mightily rule over it, and therein open the Great Wonders of God, which from Eternity were beheld in the Wiſdome of God: for the <hi>Third</hi> Dominion is generated and Created out of the <hi>firſt;</hi> and the <hi>ſecond</hi> Dominion ſhould continue in its own place (in the Noble Tincture) in Paradiſe; and ſhould open the great Wonders in the Third: and therefore Man was made <hi>Lord</hi> over all things; he had <hi>the Tincture</hi> [or life] of the Earth in his owne hand [or power] and <hi>Gold and Silver</hi> were as eaſie for him to finde, as any other viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing; The Tincture of the Earth was his Ornament and ſport, altogether childe-like, without Covetouſneſſe; he needed no other cloathing; and as the Gold was pure without droſſe, ſo was his childe-like Minde alſo.</p>

                        <p n="12">12. Conſider <hi>the Prayer of Chriſt;</hi> how his humane ſoule in God the Father called, and awakened the <hi>Verbum Domini</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> when he would doe Great Wonders [or Miracles], eſpecially about <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he<note n="h" place="margin">Awakened from Death.</note> raiſed from the Dead: Then he ſighed to his Father, and awakened the Centre of Nature and the Word in the Centre of Nature on the Croſſe of the Number Three: there the Holy Ghoſt, and the Word which the Holy Ghoſt then awakened, <hi>went forth in his ſoule:</hi> and then the ſoule of Ghoſt thanked his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had heard him, and ſaid in the power of the Word to Dead <hi>Lazarus: Lazarus come forth:</hi> and there they ſaw the power of the Word in the ſoule, that the Dead muſt ariſe: which Power the ſoule of Chriſt had opened and awakened with his knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. You muſt know that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was awakened from <hi>within,</hi> and wee ſhall all at the Laſt Day heare the voyce of God<note n="f" place="margin">Ab intus.</note> from <hi>within</hi> in the Centre of the ſoule: for the Word, with the Number Three, <hi>dwelleth within it,</hi> in the Centre on the Croſſes, and that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61125:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſoundeth forth outwards, and <hi>raiſeth up the Body</hi> of the Eſſences: For the ſoules of Men are all, as it were, <hi>one ſoule:</hi> for they are all propagated out of one onely ſoule: and therefore they will <hi>all</hi> heare the voyce of the Humane ſoule m Chriſt, and ariſe with their Bodies.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. So then when wee pray to God, God heareth our ſoule in the Centre <hi>in our ſelves,</hi> that is, the ſoule preſſeth forth with its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting will, out of the Centre of Anguiſh, out of the Abyſſe of Hell, and alſo out of the Spirit of this world, into the ſecond Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple into God, which is alſo in the ſoule: for all the <hi>Three</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are in the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Eternall, and the Corruptible, which maketh the Death of this world.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Underſtand us accuratly according to its high worth, thus: God the Father moveth not himſelfe [when thou Prayeſt] <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> onely moveth himſelfe: though that indeed availeth not us neither; But the Word which hath created our ſoule is become Man, and that hath the Holy Ghoſt in it, and he goeth forth from the Father in the Word, and <hi>meeteth</hi> the calling Minde &amp; Will, and<note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> Manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> openeth himſelf from <hi>within</hi> outwards into the ſoule; For the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Beaſtiall Body, is <hi>not worthy</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould open himſelfe in it, though ſometimes it happened ſo to the Saints, that hee went forth of the ſoule into the Outward Principle; and then the body <hi>Triumpheth,</hi> and for very Joy knoweth not what is happened to it: but in the New body of the ſoule in Chriſt, when the ſoule attaineth the body of Chriſt, <hi>in that</hi> the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. And ſo when the Devill cometh, and will ſet upon the ſoule from beneath, in the Firſt Principle, in the Centre of the firſt foure Formes to the ſource of the Fire, then the will of the ſoule preſſeth into the fleſh of Chriſt, into the <hi>ſecond</hi> Principle, inwards into it ſelfe, and there it is refreſhed and releaſed, and the Devill muſt goe downe; for that life doth not reliſh with him: yet he is ſo furious, that he ſetteth upon the ſoule, ſo often as he perceiveth it to be <hi>ſecure and careleſſe,</hi> or never ſo little burtheneth it ſelfe with falſhood and wickedneſſe: he <hi>alwayes</hi> ſeeketh an opportunity, wherein he might finde his <hi>Neaſt</hi> open [for him].</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Therefore deare Children; <hi>When yee Pray,</hi> think not that God dwelleth a farre off from you, and ſo neither heareth you, nor ſeeth you; that is a falſe Conceit and Opinion. Indeed thoſe, who <hi>will not</hi> enter into God, thoſe that ſtick faſt in their Malice and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and <hi>retaine</hi> wickedneſſe in their ſoule, thoſe indeed <hi>are not heard.</hi> Hee that cryeth to God that he would outwardly accept his words from him, and yet retaineth the Evill one in his ſoule, <hi>he mocketh God:</hi> God dwelleth not outwardly; for the outward is the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61125:128"/> Beaſtiall Starry Spirit: he dwelleth inwardly in himſelfe; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Subſtance is onely a figure and ſimilitude of God: Indeed it is of God, and generated out of the Inward Centre, and Expreſſed [or ſpoken forth] through the <hi>Verbum Fiat:</hi> but it is <hi>not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the Number Three, which is a Subſtance and Spirit in the Trinity, above Nature, and yet dwelleth in Nature in it ſelfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to Nature, as the Winde and the Light is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Fire, and yet are the ſpirit, brightneſſe, and life of the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Therefore, when you will <hi>pray,</hi> put away the abominations out of your ſoule, and enter into your ſelfe, that is, you muſt loath the Abominations, and frame a will and purpoſe in your ſoule, that you will <hi>not</hi> let ſuch abominations into you any more; alſo you muſt not ſuffer your will to ſtick in any<note n="l" place="margin">Luſts and unchaſtity.</note> abomination, and deſpaire: for when you deſpaire, you ſinck your ſelfe downe into the Abyſſe.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. But conſider, that it is the <hi>deare will and pleaſure of God,</hi> that you preſſe earneſtly and ſtrongly through, and leave the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the Devill upon his neck, and come very humbly Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a ſinfull childe to God: he is the Father of the Loſt ſonne, you have vainly riotted and ſpent your beauty and righteouſneſſe, with the Devill, and with the <hi>Antichriſtian Whore,</hi> you are amongſt the ſwine at <hi>Babell:</hi> and having loſt your Goods, you eate graines and husks with the ſwine; you are naked and torne, and are not worthy to be called his ſonne; Conſider and Imagine this in your ſelfe, for it is true, and ſo come with true converſion out of the filth and mire of the ſwine, to our Antient Loving Father, <hi>and pray for his Grace and Favour,</hi> that he would but make thee as one of his hired ſervants in his Court: acknowledge to him thy evill deeds, and that thou art not worthy to be called his ſonne.

                        <p n="20">20. When you thus enter into your ſelfe, and ſearch out your abominations, and the husks of the Devill, and of the world, which you have ſo long devoured: and Conſider of God and his Mercy, then <hi>turne not againe into the Hogſty,</hi> and ſay <hi>not,</hi> I am aſhamed to come before my good old Father; I dare not come into his ſight, for great ſhame and abomination: for I was a glorious ſonne, and now am a naked Swineheard; but conſider, that your Father taketh <hi>more</hi> care about you who are his loſt Prodigall ſonne, then you doe about his favour and love, which you have willfully trifled away.</p>

                        <p n="84">84. <hi>Vom,</hi> that is the Great Wonder, that God hath made of one two, and yet it remaines but one: it ſheweth this: for yee ſee that the Roote in the Earth is another thing then the ſtalk which groweth out of the Roote; ſo you muſt underſtand it alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true holy ſoule: that groweth as a ſtalke out of the Roote, out of the Centre of Nature; and is another thing then the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: and yet the Centre generateth it, and it moveth in full Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence over the Centre, and ruleth over it, as God ruleth over Nature, and yet there <hi>the Name of the Number-Three</hi> in the Eternall Nature <hi>ariſeth:</hi> And as God is free from Nature, and yet Nature is of his Eſſence or Subſtance, and unſeperated from God, <hi>ſo is the ſoule</hi> alſo, it is free from Nature, and is a Lord of Nature; for it is one Spirit with God, and yet bloſſometh or ſprouteth out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Indeed God is <hi>not wholly</hi> to be likened to the ſoule: for Gods Eternall will is a cauſe and beginning of Nature, but [the ſoule is to be likened] to the Majeſty of God, whoſe brightneſſe ariſeth out of the ſharpneſſe of the Eternall Nature, and yet ariſeth before Nature, like the flaſh of the Eternall Liberty, from whence Nature
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61125:136"/> in its ſharp generating, receiveth the Luſtre, and elevateth it in the fire, to a Triumphant high Light: <hi>for which cauſe ſake,</hi> the Eternall Liberty without Nature, longeth after Nature, becauſe it deſireth to be manifeſted in Wonders, and will have Majeſty in Glory and Power.</p>
                        <p n="85">85. For if there were no Nature, <hi>there would be no Glory, nor Power, much leſſe Majeſty: alſo there would be no Spirit,</hi> but onely a Stillneſſe without Subſtance [Eſſence or Beeing]: But thus in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there appeareth, Power and Vertue, Might, Glory, Majeſty, Number-Three, [Trinity] and Beeing [Eſſence or Subſtance]: and are the Manifeſtation of the Eternall Beeing. Now ſince the ſoule, as a Spirit is diſcovered and taken out of this Beeing; it hath therefore <hi>two formes,</hi> One is Nature, and the other is the Divine Bloſſom, or the Sprout out of Nature, which is above Nature, and is a Spirit in it ſelfe; as God is a Spirit in himſelfe; as you may ſee this by the Fire: the Fire is the Nature, and the flame with the Aire [or vapour] which goeth forth out of the Fire, is a Spirit with all the Power of the Fires Nature, and yet is above the Fires Nature; for the Fires Nature cannot<note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or,</hi> rule it.</note> comprehend it: and ſo alſo the <hi>Fires Nature</hi> could not ſubſiſt, if the Spirit of the Aire did not blow up the Fire againe.</p>
                        <p n="86">86. Thus the Fire generateth the Spirit with the Luſtre, and longeth earneſtly againe after the Spirit, and attracteth it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into it ſelfe, and yet reteineth it not: for it is the life of the Fire, and the Glance or Luſtre is out of the ſharpneſſe of the Fire, yet there is <hi>no feeling</hi> in the Glance or Luſtre, and yet the Glance hath the vertue or power, and not the Fire: for from the vertue of the Luſtre there ſpringeth up and groweth a ſprout, and not from the Fire, as you may perceive by the [Sun-ſhine or] Luſtre of the Sunne.</p>
                        <p n="87">87. Now ſeeing the poore ſoule in the heavy fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was captivated by <hi>two fires,</hi> viz. by that fire, through which the Spirit of this world, hath compriſed it in it ſelfe, under which lyeth the fire of the Originall; therefore it would be againe free with its Spirit-Life, in which it is an Angell, and the Image of God, and goeth with its will <hi>Vom</hi> [from], that is, as a ſprout out from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and alſo out from the Spirit of this world out of the Wonders of God, forth from them; and ſtandeth rightly quite <hi>vom</hi> [from] that is, it hath now the vertue of Nature and Mercury, in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of the Majeſty, which is another Principle, and yet hath alſo the ſevere fiery [Principle] but <hi>not manifeſted;</hi> for the Holy Principle in the Majeſty changeth the fierce wrath into Love.</p>

                        <p n="89">89.

                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>true Man</hi> in the heavenly Image, hath no Time; his Time is like a Round Crowne, or a whole Rain-Bow, which hath no beginning nor no End: for, the Image which is the ſimilitude of God, hath neither beginning nor Number: it hath ſtood from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the Wiſdome of God as a Virgin without<note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="8">8. Thus the Life conſiſteth in <hi>three Parts;</hi> as firſt, the Inward, which is Gods Eternall hidden Myſtery in the fire, from whence the Life exiſteth; and ſecondly, the Middle, which hath ſtood from Eternity as an Image or ſimilitude of God in the Wonders of God without ſubſtance, in which Gods deſire was to ſee himſelfe in an Image; and juſt as a Man ſeeth himſelfe in a Glaſſe, ſo was this alſo: And ſo thirdly, this Image in the Creation hath <hi>againe</hi> got a Glaſſe to ſee it ſelfe in, which was the <hi>Spiritus Majoris Mundi,</hi> the Spirit of the Great World, <hi>viz.</hi> the outward Principle, which is alſo a figure of the Eternall [Principle].</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And on this <hi>[outward] figure</hi> the Image hath ſo gazed, that it hath Imagined and received in the outward Image, which muſt now breake off againe: but ſeeing it is bound with its Bond to the Eternall Centre of Nature, <hi>therefore</hi> it happeneth to be <hi>very painfull to breake off,</hi> as to that bond; for there one Life is broken off</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And when the Aire ceaſeth, then the fire muſt be ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and goe into its <hi>Ether, and that is Death:</hi> for the outward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and the Inward breake off one from another; for the outward hath a beginning, and the Inward not; and <hi>therefore</hi> the outward muſt breake off.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The outward conſiſteth onely in the <hi>Sunnes</hi> Tincture, and its Dominion are <hi>the Planets</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> who alwayes drive on their Dominion to the Limit [or Period of their courſe] for Every Planet hath its Limit in that place it ſtood in at the Creation, and that is its Period, and its <hi>ſeculum,</hi> or courſe: and when it cometh to that place or point, then <hi>all whatſoever it was wholly Lord over,</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for it beginneth a new courſe or <hi>ſeculum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. But you muſt underſtand it aright [thus], Every one [of the Planets] hath not the Tincture of Life; <hi>Saturne, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> have the Great Life; <hi>Saturne</hi> ſeperateth whatſoever he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Limit, he doth it not [actually], but he leaveth the Life, and then it hath no Leader, but breaketh of it ſelfe, and ſo it is with the <hi>other</hi>[Planets].

                     <p n="15">15. This Might was given to Man; though indeed the Image of God did not ſtand thus: For <hi>Adam,</hi> before his <hi>Eve</hi> [was made], was a chaſt Virgin, not Man nor Woman: he had both the Tinctures, that in the Fire, and that in the Spirit of Meekneſſe, and could of himſelfe have brought forth after a heavenly manner, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding or rending of himſelfe, if he had <hi>ſtood out</hi> the Tryall; and then one Man had been generated from another, after that manner as <hi>Adam</hi> in his Virgin-like manner was Man, and the Image of God.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. For that which is out of the Eternall, hath alſo an Eternall manner of Generating, its ſubſtance muſt goe wholly out of the Eternall, <hi>elſe</hi> it ſubſiſteth not in Eternity. But having no Tongue to<note n="m" place="margin">

                     <p n="17">17. <hi>A Dead Man</hi> hath no breath, neither hath he any fire in his body: the Body hath no feeling, for it breaketh [or corrupteth] altogether: its Eſſences goe into the Earth: its Elementary Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aire, goeth into the Aire, and vaniſheth in a vapour; the water and bloud is received by the water and Earth, and then there remaineth nothing of the outward Man; <hi>he is quite gone,</hi> for he hath beginning and End, all his Eſſences are gone.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Underſtand us after this manner: as the Image ſtood in a forme from Eternity, and yet it had no certain forme, but was a Wonder, like one that <hi>Dreameth</hi> of a ſight or Image, and ſo it hath been foreſeene in the Wiſdome of God, with all wonders.</p>
                     <p n="19">19.

Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule? the ſoule is ſo precious that nothing can truly be valued at ſo high a Rate. To ſave it is the greateſt gaine, to looſe it is the greateſt loſſe: then who will not highly priſe the ſtudy and underſtanding of the way to ſave it. Chriſt ſaith, He that will ſave his ſoule ſhall looſe it, and he that will looſe his ſoule ſhall ſave it: but who underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this? we know it is the earneſt deſire of every ſoule to be ſaved, and to be happy and glorious, but the way is very unknowne to us poore fallen ſoules, for we can hardly ſuppoſe that looſing will be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our ſelves: Chriſt alſo taught that the way to Glory was through many tribulations and Death; this way he entred into Glory, and ſo have all the bleſſed from the beginning of the world, and can no otherwiſe to the end thereof: but how ſhall a ſoule know the way to looſe and deny it ſelfe, ſo that it may aſſuredly attaine Eternall Salvation?

All this we ſhall fully underſtand, and all Myſteries when God ſhall manifeſt himſelf in us, if we earneſtly deſire it with all humility, ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall loſing of our ſoules, and being nothing in our

                  <p>On the <hi>18. Novemb. Stilo novo,</hi> betimes in the morning he cal'd one of his ſons, and asked if he alſo
<pb facs="tcp:61125:171"/> heard that excellent muſick? he ſaid no, then he had that the dore ſhould be opened, that that muſick might be the better heard. Afterwards he asked what a clock it was? being anſwer'd that it had ſtruck two; he ſaid, it is not yet my time, my time is three houres hence, in the meane time he was heard to ſpeake theſe words.</p>
                  <q>O thou ſtrong God of hoſts deliver me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy will, O thou crucified Lord Jeſus, have mercy upon me, and receive me into thy Kingdome.</q>
                  <p>When it was neare about ſix of the clock, he tooke his leave of his wife and ſonnes, and bleſſed them, and ſaid; now I goe hence into Paradiſe; then ſpake to his ſonne to turne him, and ſighing deeply, he mildly and quietly departed this world.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. Then if we diſcerne and know that there is not onely Light and Majeſty, but alſo Darkeneſſe, as is plaine; it behoves us to know whence Darkeneſſe ariſeth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For in the Eternity beyond Nature there can be no Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for there is nothing to bring it forth: we muſt onely looke into the Will and the Deſiring, for a deſiring is attracting.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And whereas in the Eternity it hath nothing but onely it ſelfe, it draweth it ſelfe into the Will, and maketh the Will full, and that is its darkeneſſe, whereas otherwiſe, if it were not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it were a Nothing,<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p n="12">12. Now the Light is good and hath<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>power.</hi>

                        </gap> the free Light is ſharpened in the Eſſence in the ſharpe ſtirring, whereby we come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the<note n="r" place="margin">Lightening.</note> fire-flaſh, and the eagerneſſe; and yet we cannot ſay that there is any rending.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. For that which is Eternall without beginning admits no ſevering, but ſtands as a wheele which begetteth it ſelfe in it ſelfe: whereof you have a ſimilitude in the Mind of Man, where indeede there is a Will of a riſing and runing, but no removing: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Will is, the greater alſo is the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>Beeing.</hi>

                     <p n="15">15. Thus the ſtill Liberty which is neither Darkeneſſe nor Light is ſharpned in the ſharpe Deſiring attracting, ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth as a flaſh which ſhineth.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61125:174"/>16. Alſo we cannot ſay that the Liberty doth take in the flaſh, for from Eternity it hath had Nothing: but we can well ſay, that the Light and Splendor ſhineth in the Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. For that which is free letteth in the Light, but that which is not free (as the<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>eſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</hi>
                        </note> harſhneſſe which maketh Darkeneſſe, and is materiall, to ſpeake in a Spirituall ſenſe) that doth not receive the Light.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. This we can truely ſay, that whatſoever is tranſparent and not of a<note n="u" place="margin">Mild <hi>or</hi> fluid.</note> groſſe Nature doth take in the Light, as appeareth by the water which taketh in the Light, and the harſh Earth not.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Moreover in Fire you have a ſufficient manifeſtation of the Eſſence of all Eſſences, for you ſee that the Fire burneth in an harſh drie matter, for it is the harſh Deſire which entreth into it ſelfe like a great anguiſh, and reacheth after the Liberty; where alſo it receiveth the Liberty, like a flaſh, and it kindleth by the flaſh that it burneth.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. And although it muſt be underſtood that there is no ſuch fire in the Eternall Eſſence as that is which appeareth externally, yet it is internally, in the harſh Deſire and externally remaineth darke: Therefore the Eternall Fire is externally darke, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, as it is in it ſelfe in the Will of the Eternall Liberty it is a Light, which ſhineth in the Still Eternity.</p>

For that which is before the Deſire, beyond the ſeeking is Free and a Nothing, and yet it is: yet if it were a thing that could be perceived, it were an Eſſence, and muſt ſubſiſt in that Eſſence which brought it forth: but ſeeing it is without Eſſence, it is the Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi> Good: For it is no ſource, and hath alſo no Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but it is a Reſt and an Eternall Peace.</p>

The ☉ is the Eye of God, the Eye of Eternity; This maketh and is a Glaſſe, and it is a round circle like a Globe not like a Ringle; for we cannot deſcribe it otherwiſe.

                        <p n="31">31.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61125:175"/> of the Soule thereinto; and ſo we ſee it, elſe it muſt remaine in Silence; and this hand could not deſcribe any thing of it.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. Now ſeeing that in the Eternity there is ſuch an Eye, which is God himſelfe, (and yet is not called God but Eternity; and according to the Eye he is called A and ☉, before the A there is Nothing, and in the ☉ there is All, and in the A and ☉ beginning and End) hence we finde, that there is a Will in the ☉, and the Will is the ☉ it ſelfe which maketh the A, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Eternall beginning of the<note n="e" place="margin">Drawing <hi>or</hi> longing, <hi>or</hi> attracting.</note> ſeeking) ſo that the Abyſſe beholdeth it ſelfe, and maketh a Forme in it ſelfe like a Globe.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. For the Eye finding no bottome, it cloſeth it ſelfe, and becommeth like a round Globe of Glaſſe, and ſo it is the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Eternity, in that it can finde it ſelfe: for there is no finding in the Abyſſe, becauſe there is no place or limit but the meere Abyſſe: and when it doth find it ſelfe in the Eye, yet it findeth nothing but the Eye, which is the Globe.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. Now the Eye maketh the Globe, and it is the Globe, and all put together is a<note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p n="36">36. Then if there be a Will, which is the Eye, and which keepeth the Eye, that keeping is the Deſire of the Eye, and ſo the Deſire cauſeth an attraction in the Eye, yet nothing is there but the Eye: and the Deſire onely attracteth it ſelfe in the Eye, and impregnateth the Eye with that which is attracted, ſo that it becommeth full, and yet alſo nothing is there but a darkening of the Free Eye; yet the Eye is not darke, but the Deſire in the Eye is impregnated in it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. For the Will of the Eye is ſtill: and the Deſire of the Will maketh it ſelfe full, and the Eye continueth free in it ſelfe: For it is free in and from Eternity, and this we call the Eternall Liberty in all our Writings.</p>

                        <p n="46">46. Now the Liberty in the Deſire ſuffereth it ſelfe not to be bound or captivated, but changeth it ſelfe from the Red flaſh into Light, into a glance of the Majeſty, and it is an exulting great Joy in the Liberty.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. For the Eye is made manifeſt in the Light, and the<note n="a" place="margin">Or Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</note> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiality is made mannifeſt in the Will, and then it is knowne what Light or Darkneſſe is: alſo thus the Eternity is knowne, and ſo Gods Holineſſe alwayes ariſeth in the wonders from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and it hath neither limit nor beginning, for it is an Eternall beginning comprehended in Nothing but only in the Wonders, which are its owne Eſſence, where there is neither limit nor<note n="b" place="margin">Time or yeares.</note> number.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. And thus nothing is knowne in the ſtill Eternity, but the glance of the Majeſty, and the Spirit which is borne in the Will, and the Majeſty hath the<note n="c" place="margin">Regiment.</note> Dominion.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. Beloved friend, underſtand the ſenſe right: we meane not, that the Birth apprehendeth the Liberty without, but within it ſelfe in its Centre, it apprehendeth it ſelfe in it ſelfe, and maketh Majeſty in it ſelfe, and yet there is no including there, but it is, as when life ariſeth from Death or from Nothing, which<note n="d" place="margin">Life.</note> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth onely in it ſelfe, and this is called a<note n="e" place="margin">Principium.</note> Principle: and that wherein it dwelleth is called Nature, which hath ſeven Spirits and Formes, as is to be ſeene in our ſecond and third Booke.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. Yet this Principle hath but one Spirit, which is the life of that Principle, and it hath but one will neither, which is the<note n="f" place="margin">Or ſatiating.</note> fulfilling of the Eternity with the glance of the Majeſty.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. For this principle is the Power proceeding from the will of Eternity, and the entrance, or the Eternall beginning of the Power, is the Life and the Spirit of the power, which thruſteth forth the Eſſences of the begettreſſe, and openeth the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Majeſty.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. And the whole Eye (which hath thus<note n="g" place="margin">Or formed, or figured.</note> made it ſelfe a Glaſſe in the A and O) is all things, it is the Eternity, and in it ſelfe in the Eye it begetteth the Majeſty, which is the Heart and power of the Eye, and alſo the Spirit, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Power in the Heart, even from the fiery Light fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Eſſences.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. Thus underſtand the Holy Ternary in one Eſſence; the Father is the Eternity without Ground, which is Nothing and yet all things, and in the Eye of his glance he ſeeth that he is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61125:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> all things: and in the Power of the Majeſtie he feeleth, taſteth and ſmelleth that he is Good, that is, that he is God: although the<note n="h" place="margin">The Tau or Croſſe.</note> T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>viz:</hi> the<note n="i" place="margin">Schwerigkeit oft Breetheitguere.</note> harſhneſſe) ariſeth in the Centre.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. And in the Spirit is the moving of the Power, and the Multiplication without ground and number, wherein conſiſteth an Eternall bottomleſſe multitude, and all in Power.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. For, that which hath no ground hath no number, nor is there any ſhutting up or comprehenſion therein, and that which is within it ſelfe cannot be knowne<note n="k" place="margin">Or without <hi>ab extra.</hi>
                           </note> externally, but it may be felt by the Spirit; Thus the Internall driveth out from it ſelf and manifeſteth it ſelfe in Figures, or elſe God could not be known.</p>
                        <p n="56">56. Thus God is together one Spirit: and is from Eternity in three beginnings and ends, and that onely in himſelfe: There is no place found in his ſight: and he hath nothing in himſelfe that may be compared to him; alſo there is nothing which can ſearch and manifeſt any thing further then his Spirit: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes manifeſteth it ſelfe from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. He is an Eternall ſeeker and finder of himſelfe in the great Wonders; and that which he findeth he findeth in the Power: He is the Opener of the Power; Nothing is like him, neither doth any thing find him, but that which yieldeth it ſelfe to be his owne, that entreth into him: That which denyeth it ſelfe to be, in that thing the Spirit of God is all things; For it is one onely Will in the Eternall Nothing, and yet it is in all things as Gods Spirit it ſelfe is.</p>
                        <p n="58">58. And this, my beloved friend, is the Higheſt Myſterie: Therefore if you would finde it ſeeke it not in me but in your ſelfe, though not in your Reaſon neither, which muſt be as dead, and your Deſire and will muſt be in God: and ſo God becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the will and the deed in you: alſo the Spirit of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your will into himſelfe, and then you may well ſee what God is, and what Spirits child this hand is, and from what kinde of Spirit it writeth.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. Furthermore I brotherly exhort you, that you ſeeke not with ſuch eagerneſſe, you will not reach the bottome of it with ſuch ſearching: although you are knowne and beloved of God; and therefore we give you this for a Rule, yet externally I have no power to give it you.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. But follow my counſell, leave off your laborious ſearching in Reaſon, and enter into the will of God, into Gods Spirit, and caſt outward Reaſon away, and then your will is Gods will, and Gods Spirit will ſeek you within you.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. And if he find your will in him, then he manifeſteth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61125:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> himſelfe in your will, as in his owne propriety. For if you quit that will, then it is His who is all things: and when he moveth goe you with him, for you have Divine Power, and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſearch he is in it, and then nothing is hid from the will: thus you ſee in his Light, and are his.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. And let no feare terrifie you, there is nothing can take it away but your own imagination, let not that enter into your will, and ſo you ſhall worke the wonders of God in his Spirit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me your brother in him, elſe I ſhall be but as one that is dumb to you: This I tell you for good will.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. And ſeeing wee write of the Eternity, to the end to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your will, concerning the ſoule, (our purpoſe herein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the will of God) wee will therefore firſt ſhew you the ground of the ſoule, and then its Originall: and ſo open your eyes that you may be freed from your laborious ſearching.</p>
                        <p n="64">64. For you have now to your old-age gone about this, and ſo farre as I underſtand, you have not yet found that deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the Spirit: But ſeeing it is Gods will that you ſhould know it, and have it given you for a reward of your ſo great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, therefore have a care that you receive it aright: and then that you caſt not the Pearle before ſwine, which are not worthy of it, nor will not be worthy of it to Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. For that which ſhall be revealed to you here, belongeth to the Children of God, therefore be faithfull and employ it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, and not according to humane reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. For it is ſo ſublime that it will not endure earthlineſſe which proceeds from Covetouſneſſe, Pride, Selfe-glory and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, although you be not ſuch; but looke well into whom you poure oyle, for it is poyſon to many: let others themſelves ſeeke as you have done; But give the Children bread that they may eate, and praiſe Our Father which is in Heaven, for to that end it is given you.</p>

As wee have opened an entrance and a glaſſe to you of the Eternall Originall, from whence the Eternall fire proceeds, and what it is, ſo it is alſo neceſſary, that wee ſhew you further according to the higheſt depth, what the Eternall Nature is, in its propagation.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. Wherein wee muſt underſtand two Kingdomes, the one good and pleaſant, the other an evill, wrathfull, and ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſad one: of which the Philoſophers from the beginning of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61125:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> the world have treated, and ſought after it, but the time of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was not then.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. But now it is at hand, that the hidden<note n="l" place="margin">Or ſecret Myſterie.</note> thing ſhould be found, not onely by me, but alſo by many that will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and humble themſelves to God, and ſeeke in his Spirit and will; it will be found in the Eye of God onely, and no where elſe; therefore let none dive deeper in ſearching elſewhere, or he will find the Devill.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. Seeing then the Eternity is thus which yet is Nothing, and yet there is Light and Darkneſſe, Life and Spirit, which are all things: and ſo there is a ſeeking (that is, a deſire) in both, to find it ſelfe, though there be Nothing that can be<note n="m" place="margin">Or that can find any thing.</note> found but the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="71">71. Now ſeeing it hath nothing that it can find, and yet the Deſire goeth on Eternally forward, therefore the Deſire is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the ſeeking will, the ſimilitude of the Eye of God, and it is as a glaſſe of the Eternall Eye which is called God.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. Now this is in two manner of wayes, one according to the Light, and the other according to the Darkneſſe: for the ſeeking is in both; and yet there is no departing of the one from the other; the Light is in the Internall, and the Darkneſſe in the Externall, and yet that which is moſt internall is alſo moſt Externall, but the Light is the middlemoſt.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. For it is in the Nothing; therefore it cannot be the moſt internall, for it hath no Place nor limit; it is its owne finding, which the Darkneſſe findeth not, but the will in the Darkneſſe, which deſireth the Light, goeth out from the darkneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth Eternally in the Light.</p>
                        <p n="74">74. Now the Deſire of the Light preſenteth a Modell like it ſelfe, wherein the Eternity is manifeſt: that is, all whatſoever the Spirit, in the Eternall power of God, findeth in it ſelfe from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. This Modell is not God the Eternity it ſelfe; for it taketh its beginning in the Spirit, and it is the wonder of the Spirit which it ſeeketh and findeth from Eternity; and<note n="n" place="margin">The Modell.</note> it is in the Eye of God as a figure, and all the wonders of the Abyſſe of Eternity are therein, and are beheld in the Light of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as one wonder in many Endleſſe wonders.</p>
                        <p n="76">76. Alſo it is an Image of God, a virgin full of purity and chaſtity, and no begettreſſe, for the Holy Spirit onely openeth the Wonders in the Power.</p>

                        <p n="79">79. She is a Circle and Modell, which ſo openeth our mind that wee ſee her, and God in her; for our will is caſt into her, and ſhe is in our Will: Therefore wee ſpeake of God, and ſee him in her, as in our Owne propriety, according to the hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Humanity, this<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>Seeing.</hi>

We muſt ſpeak ſomewhat alſo of<note n="q" place="margin">Of the way or condition of</note> Darkneſſe: It is in it ſelfe an incloſing, though there be nothing which barreth it up, but it ſhutteth it ſelfe up, and begetteth it ſelfe, and is its owne Enemy to it ſelfe, for it maketh its own ſource, without Ground and number; and hath no giver that can beſtow this but the Darkneſſes owne Forme.</p>
                        <p n="81">81. It ariſeth from the firſt Deſiring when the Deſiring<note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or</hi> draweth into it ſelfe.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth it ſelfe and impregnateth it ſelfe, ſo that it becometh a very ſtinging, bitter<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi>

                        <p n="82">82. Thus the great Anguiſh ariſeth in the bitter ſuffering: and yet nothing is there neither that can ſuffer, but it is thus in it ſelfe, and it is its owne Life: and if this were not, the<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>glance.</hi>

                        <p n="84">84. Therefore God is the moſt hidden, and the moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and that is the<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p n="85">85. Seeing then there is an Abyſſe, which in regard of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61125:179"/> impreſſion of the darkneſſe is called Ground, wherein the ſource is a cauſe of the life: (for the wrathfull flaſh is the awakening of the life, although it be nothing there but in it ſelfe) and it is alſo a Deſiring, and that deſiring is a ſeeking, and yet it can find nothing but a glaſſe, and a ſimilitude of the darke wrathfull ſource wherein Nothing is.</p>
                        <p n="86">86. For it is a Figure of the Earneſt wrathfull flaſh, and of the ſharp and<note n="z" place="margin">Sterne.</note> ſevere power which is Gods according to which he calleth himſelfe, a conſuming Fire, and an Angry<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>zealous.</hi>

                        <p n="88">88. As there is a Threefold ſource in every thing, and each is alwayes the Glaſſe, begetter and cauſe of the other; nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, all things are according to the Eſſence of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</p>
                        <p n="89">89. Seeing then there is a Glaſſe in the Abyſſe, in which the ſource beholdeth it ſelfe: ſo it is alſo a figure and Image of the ſource, which ſtandeth before the ſource, and doth or bringeth forth nothing, but is a Virgin of the ſource wherein the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Flaſh<note n="b" place="margin">

Seeing then, two Principles are ſo in one Eſſence, (as no man with Reaſon can ſpeake againſt it; for every life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in venome and in Light, each in its owne principle, and according as it hath the ſource, ſo hath it alſo its Light) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſearch what that is which ſuſtaineth the life that it be not ſtarved, and what driveth forth its ſource, that it can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever.</p>
                        <p n="100">100. This now alſo hath two differences, for the Light-life hath its owne ſource and driving, and the Fire-life alſo its ſource and driving, each in it ſelfe: but the Fire-life is the cauſe of the Light-life, and the Light-life is Lord of the Fire-life, and herein lyeth the<note n="i" place="margin">Myſterium Magnum.</note> Great Myſterie.</p>

For if there were no Fire there would be no Light, and alſo no Spirit, and if there were no Spirit to blow up the Fire it would be ſmothered, and Darkneſſe would be, and the one would be a Nothing without the other, therefore they belong both together, and yet divide themſelves one from another, but without any<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
                           </note> fleeing, and yet there is a fleeing of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="102">102. You may underſtand it by this: looke upon the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire; firſt there is the Matter from whence it burneth, <hi>viz.</hi> the harſh attracted bitter ſubſtance, which hath an Anguiſh ſource, and is a<note n="l" place="margin">Corpus Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> darke Body, whether it be wood or any ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p n="103">103. Now when it comes to be kindled, you ſee Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, firſt the wood, in the Darkneſſe with the Externall<note n="m" place="margin">Property and Condition, or Quality.</note> ſource of this world, which alſo hath its owne Life, or elſe it would not take fire.</p>
                        <p n="104">104. Now the Fire hath a wrathfull, harſh, ſtrong, bitter deſiring<note n="n" place="margin">Quality.</note> ſource which begetteth thirſt, a devouring and conſuming, and the great bitterneſſe is its right Spirit, an Enrager and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which hath all Eſſences of the Life in it, and it is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the life and of the driving, otherwiſe there would be no burning.</p>
                        <p n="105">105. That maketh the great anguiſh-ſeeking after the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and in the Fire it attaineth the Liberty: for it conſumeth the darkneſſe in the wrathfulneſſe, and alſo the matter of the Fire, from which it burneth.</p>
                        <p n="106">106. And thereby wee know that one Spirit, which divideth it ſelfe into two Principles,<note n="o" place="margin">Inſeparabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> into two Spirits, but not ſevered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet fleeing one before another, and the one catcheth or apprehendeth not the other, and the one is the life and cauſe of the other.</p>
                        <p n="107">107. And therefore they are two Principles ſeeing they have a twofold ſource and life, and yet there is but one roote from whence they proceed, and one of them affordeth life, and the other affordeth food for that life: This is a wonder and yet no wonder, for there is nothing that can wonder at it, for it ſelfe is All things in one only Eſſence.</p>

Now the Anguiſh is an horrible ſharpneſſe, and thus the Liberty is taken and ſharpned, ſo that it becommeth a fire-flaſh and the Anguiſh-will in the ſharpneſſe of the bitter flaſh, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Subſtantiality, be it wood or any other thing.</p>
                        <p n="110">110. Now when this hath conſumed it, then the Anguiſh is a Darkneſſe againe, and the flaſh remaineth hidden in it ſelfe againe; and is an Extinguiſhing, and the anguiſh is in the darkneſſe as at firſt, before the flaſhing of the Fire, and it remaineth onely in a terrible ſource, where the bitterneſſe is alwayes made more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the rough attraction.</p>
                        <p n="111">111. Now this is thus according to the Outward Principle of this world, as we ſee undeniably by experience; ſeeing then there is an alwayes enduring Eſſence in the Eternity, we therefore demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it thus: behold and conſider it deeply and reade this with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                        <p n="112">112. The ſinking of the anguiſh in the Eternall darkneſſe, is an Eternall hunger, and an Eternall thirſt, and an Eternall Deſiring; and the darkneſſe in it ſelfe attaineth nothing in the Eternity, that<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                           </note> it can ſatiate it ſelfe withall out of the<note n="q" place="margin">Underſtand by this the ſinking of the hunger and thirſt of Hell, and of Anger.</note> Eternity, therefore it is rightly and truly the hunger and thirſt of the Abyſſe of Hell and of the anger of God.</p>
                        <p n="113">113. But the will in the anguiſh (becauſe it can attaine or finde nothing) therefore it maketh a figure and a ſimilitude to it ſelfe in the deſiring with the eager attraction, and the eager, harſh, bitter darke Eſſence, is the Materiall ſimilitude it ſelfe, it eateth it ſelfe, and is it ſelfe the matter of the Fire, that ſo the Eternall flaſh may alwayes continue, and the wrath is alwayes an Eternally continuing burning, and burneth Eternally, out of the Darkneſſe, and hath its owne Life in it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> the bitter ſting of the Anguiſh, which rageth and raveth, and is the<note n="r" place="margin">Rigling.</note> ſtirring and originall of the Life, and that is<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</hi>

                        <p n="114">114. And underſtand hereby the Eternall deſiring ſeeking, an Eternall Coveting, and yet having nothing but it ſelfe an Eternall Envious Enmity, a ſeeking of the Eſſences, when the innumerable, and Groundleſſe multitude is alwayes borne in the Will: and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall craftineſſe, a continuall riſing in the hunger, an Eternall fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſimilitude of its owne deſire, the ſimilitude of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences, in the Will, and this is manifeſt in the flaſh: for the flaſh elevateth it ſelfe ever above the darkneſſe; and the Eſſences are in the flaſh, and are continually brought into the Will.</p>
                        <p n="115">115. Thus the Fire-will is a<note n="t" place="margin">Sucking <hi>or</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> ſeeking of the high ſwelling Pride, and a Contempt of the darkneſſe: it contemneth its owne roote; it is covetous and would devoure more then it hath, or more then it ſhould, it hath all luſts; for the deſiring Eſſences are manifeſt in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61125:181"/> the Fire, and thence it cometh to paſſe that in each Will each Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is againe Centre of a whole ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p n="116">116. And this is the cauſe of Creation of this world; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Modell hath appeared from Eternity as in a Glaſſe, and was in the Eternal Eſſences in the figure, as in a virgine without bringing forth, and was ſeene in the light of God: and hence cometh the Matter of the Earth, Starres and Elements, alſo All Arts, wit and ſubtlety, deceit, falſhood, covetouſneſſe, haughtineſſe in the Creatures of this world.</p>
                        <p n="117">117. For this world is a Materiall ſeeking, comes from the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note n="u" place="margin">Viz. ſeeking.</note> and is become materiall and perceptible in the Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> in the word<note n="x" place="margin">

                        <p n="123">123. Seeing then Man by his Imagination hath deſtroyed the heavenly Angelicall Body, and hath brought it into a corruptible number, that is, into the outward Principle, and therefore he is in it: for he hath loſt the Paradiſicall number, and is placed in the hundreth number, wherein he is alſo now given up to the Outward Life, as to his leader, that is, he hath given himſelfe up to this Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that his number, to be fulfilled in the Circle of the Outward Principle, is cleerely knowne to us.</p>
                        <p n="124">124. If we knew certainly the houre of the ſixt Day wherein the Creation was finiſhed, we could then ſet you downe the yeare and day (we meane the<note n="i" place="margin">

                        <p n="126">126.

So alſo conſider the Eternall Fire further, and take a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude from all ſorts of fire in this world, for that which is a Spirit, in the Eternity, is a ſubſtance in this world. You ſee alſo that fire in it ſelfe is an anguiſhing wrathfull riſing bitter Eſſence and ſource, and yet you ſee nothing elſe in the proper Forme of Fire, but the flaſh which ſhineth, you ſee not the ſource, you can onely feele that.</p>
                        <p n="133">133. You ſee alſo that the fire when it burneth, ſendeth up from it ſelfe a Smoake, in which there is water, whence ſoote cometh which ſticketh to the ſides, eſpecially where the fire is incloſed and not free, then the ſoote is ſeene as in a chimney; and the ſoot and water are in one another, and thus the Materiall Earth cometh originally from the Eternall fire; which Lucifer kindled; Then in the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe Time began, and the Creation was after that manner which is mentioned in the Third Booke.</p>
                        <p n="134">134. Underſtand, the<note n="p" place="margin">Myſterium Magnum.</note> Great Myſterie further: you ſee that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fire giveth light, and you ſee alſo that Aire goeth forth from the ſource of the Fire, and you know very well that if the fire had no Aire to blow it up, it would be ſmothered, as all fires are ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered when they have no Aire, and yet they produce Aire.</p>
                        <p n="135">135. The Aire is the life of the fire, and the Aire hath its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from the Anguiſhing bitter ſtirring ſource of the Eſſences, out of the Will: Now you ſee alſo very well, that fire muſt have few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to burne, or elſe it is a Darkneſſe, and although it devoure it ſelfe (by its eager attraction,) yet that fire is nothing but a ſource

                        <p n="140">140. For the Light is a Fire alſo, a very yerning fire, a deſiring fire, and a perpetuall finding Fire, which alwayes findeth what is generated in the Originall.</p>

For the ſinking entreth into the ſtill Eternity; <hi>viz.</hi> into the Liberty; and as the ſource of the wrathfull Fire did remaine in it ſelfe, in its life, ſo the ſinking is a going quite out from the fire-Life, and yet it proceedeth from the fire-life, but it hath not the ſource thereof, for it is broken off from that in Death: and the limit of the Separation is a Death; ſo that the ſinking Life pierceth through Death, and ſprouteth through Death forth in another world, and hath another Subſtantiality, (<hi>viz.</hi> another water) wherein the Light ſhineth: and therein is no wrathfulneſſe.</p>

                        <p n="275">275. You know that every life conſiſteth in fire and Water, and the Eſſentiality is its Body, and the Body proceedeth from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit: for it is the food of the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is the food of the body, and the higheſt and greateſt<note n="u" place="margin">Or <hi>Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                        <p n="276">276. Now then Fire is the firſt cauſe of life, and Light is the ſecond cauſe, and the Spirit the third cauſe: and yet there is but one Eſſence, which cloſeth it ſelfe in one onely Body, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, and ſo findeth by ſeeking.</p>
                        <p n="277">277. And every Eſſence<note n="x" place="margin">Is.</note> conſiſteth<note n="y" place="margin">In.</note> of two Eſſences, <hi>viz.</hi> of an inward and an outward, one ſeeketh and findeth the other, the outward is Nature, the inward is Spirit above Nature, and yet there is no ſeparation but in that which is included in a Time; there the Time parteth the limit; ſo that the End findeth the beginning.</p>
                        <p n="278">278. Thus you ſee alſo, how the true Eſſentiality ariſeth from the Light: for it is the ſatiating of the will: the water ariſeth from the meekneſſe of the Light, for the Deſire taketh hold of the meekneſſe and keepeth it: becauſe it hath a good<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>taſte.</hi>
                           </note> reliſh: and ſo the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becommeth Eſſentiall, and it is an Eſſence of the Fire, a ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of the deſiring Wrath, a quenching of the Wrath, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality of the Fire: for when the body<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>periſheth,</hi> or <hi>dyeth,</hi> or <hi>corrupteth,</hi> or <hi>departeth.</hi>
                           </note> is dead, then its Spirit is in the beginning; in that which gave a beginning to it, it is in that Glaſſe.</p>
                        <p n="279">279. Now then as the ſource is twofold, ſo alſo the water is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; <hi>viz.</hi> an outward and an inward, the one belongeth to the Spirit, the other to the outward Life; the outward is as it were a Death, and the inward is the life of the outward, for the outward ſtandeth between Wrath and Paradiſe, in the<note n="b" place="margin">Death that is ſunke downe into the Centre in a thing.</note> inſunken Death, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61125:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Inward is Paradiſe it ſelfe: for the Spirit groweth up therein out of the Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="280">280. You may very well ſee that this is true, as followeth. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Summer and Winter, Heat and Cold, and your eyes will ſoone be opened, if you be borne not<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>without.</hi>
                           </note> outwardly but within your ſelfe, with a true Magick will to finde God; for it is very<note n="d" place="margin">Viſible.</note> plaine.</p>
                        <p n="281">281. For the Water in the Deep ariſeth from the fire, not from the Wrath but from the Light; for the Light proceedeth from the fire and hath a<note n="e" place="margin">Longing, Sucking, Drawing.</note> ſeeking of its owne, it ſeeketh a Glaſſe, to behold it ſelfe in, and it ſeeketh an Habitation, and draweth it<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>in.</hi>
                           </note> by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire into it ſelfe, and dwelleth therein, and that which is drawne in is water which receiveth the Light: elſe if the light did not dwell in the water, the deep of the world could not comprehend the Light: The water is the ſatiating of the Deſire of the Light.</p>
                        <p n="282">282. And the water againe ſeeketh the Glaſſe, and would have a Houſe to dwell in, and that is fleſh; as you ſee, the water recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſhadow of all bodily ſubſtances, ſo that the body may be ſeene in the water, and that is, becauſe the ſeeking of the Water hath captivated it.</p>
                        <p n="283">283. Furthermore you ſee herein, the End of Nature; For the Eye findeth its Life in the Water: and ſo goeth back into the ſeventh Forme, and ſeeth its body in the Water: the Outward deſireth no more, this body deſireth no other body more in the outward, but it looketh back after its Mother, of which a Glaſſe is a true Example, which is water and fire, and it receiveth the Image very plainely.</p>
                        <p n="284">284. And thus you ſee, that the End goeth back againe, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beginning and no further<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                           </note> in the outward. For this world hath a limit, and is included in Time, and haſteneth to the limit, and there the End findeth the beginning, and this world is as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell or Glaſſe in the Beginning: by this you may finde ſomewhat of the Myſterie, and behave your ſelves well in the beginning, that you may be found to be a wonder in the Love of God.</p>
                        <p n="285">285. And know that the ſecond<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>Forme.</hi>
                           </note> kinde of water is in the Spirit, it is the Glaſſe of its father, of its maker, which dwelleth in the Spirit, and is found onely by its Maker, it ſelfe findeth not it ſelfe: for ſo long as a thing goeth<note n="i" place="margin">Outward.</note> forward, there is no finding in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the Spirit which dwelleth in the inward, that findeth it ſelfe in the outward.</p>
                        <p n="286">286. Yet the outward life findeth not the inward, unleſſe it have the Spirit of the inward; and then it findeth by the inward Spirit, and ſo the outward life ſpeaketh of the inward, and knoweth it not; but the inward Spirit filleth the outward, ſo that the outward is as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61125:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> it were a mouth, and the Inward hath, and produceth the Word, and ſo the Inward Kingdome is manifeſt in the outward by the ſound: which is a Wonder.</p>
                        <p n="287">287. The Inward is a Prophet: and the outward apprehendeth it not, but if he doe apprehend it, he hath the Eſſentiality of God in him, that is, the Divine fleſh, Chriſts fleſh, the fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and yet the Prophet is in the Spirit, but that fleſh receiveth his power and vertue, and aſſureth the outward Man that he doth nothing but what his Maker will have done, and ſuch a condition this pen is in, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p n="288">288. And thus we know the<note n="k" place="margin">Foundation.</note> Ground of this world, that it is a figure of the Inward according to both the Mothers, that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both the Fires, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the fire of Wrath, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fire of Light; The Sun is a<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>inſtance.</hi>
                           </note> Modell or Glaſſe of the Light of Eternity, and the outward fire is a Glaſſe of the Wrath, and the Eſſentiality of them both is Water and Earth: the<note n="m" place="margin">Reſembleth the Father.</note> Earth is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiality of Wrath, and the<note n="n" place="margin">The Sonne.</note> water of the Light, and the<note n="o" place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt.</note> Aire of the Eternall Spirit; which is called, God, the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p n="289">289. Yet you muſt know, that this world is not the Eſſence of Eternity, but a figure, or a Glaſſe of it; therefore it is ſaid to be a peculiar<note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or</hi> third Principle.</note> Principle, becauſe it had its owne life, and yet conſiſteth only in the Magick ſeeking of the Inward.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. The Arme at the left hand of the Croſſe ſignifieth, that its originall is in the Fire, and it containeth the firſt Principle, and ſo belongeth to the Father: and ſtandeth in the Originall Eye, in the ſtrong and eager power, as a Lord and Ruler over Nature.</p>

                     <p n="13">13. The Spirit parteth it ſelfe into the whole body (wee meane in the Tincture) into all the Members, they are all of them its branches: The Spirit of the ſoule reſembleth the whole Man, with every member.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And herein it is the true Image of God alſo, for the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the Spirit of it, if it be faithfull: if not, then the Devill dwelleth in it: to which of theſe it giveth it ſelfe, either to Covetouſneſſe, and haughtineſſe, or to love and humility, to that it belongeth.</p>

                     <p n="13">13. And thus the Phur deſireth fleſh, that is, a<note place="margin">Meſch, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>or</hi> concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Maſſe of fire and water, and it is conceived and borne in the Tincture.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And the Tincture is the ſprouting of the body, and the fire is an Originall of the Spirit, through the Tincture; for the Spirit of the ſoule taketh its Originall in the Tincture, which then figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the true Image according to the Image of God, that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the three Principles: for in the Fire, the ſoule is no ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God; but in the Spirit it is the Image of God.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. For, the firſt ſoule was incorporated with the Divine Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality together in the Tincture, ſo that it had the Divine body in the virgine of Wiſdome, in which the Tincture ſtandeth, which is the Angelicall Image.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And ſo wee anſwer you, that as to the ſoule onely beſide the Spirit; it is a Globe of Fire, with an Eye of Fire, and an Eye of Light, which turne themſelves backwards into one another, as the wheele in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> that could goe on every ſide: though <hi>Babell</hi> hath contrived another meaning about it, but a blinde one without Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="17">
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61125:205"/>17. But, as to its Tincture proceeding from the Light, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both from the fire and Light,<note n="ſ" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it is a Spirit, in which the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the ſoule, and of the Spirit cannot part aſunder in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It is an Eternall band, and when the bloud<note n="t" place="margin">Run out.</note> is gone, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dieth, then that band remaineth in Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. As to the ſoule onely; the body belongeth not to the Eſſence of the ſoule, they are two ſeverall Eſſences: for the body is the Glaſſe and dwelling houſe of the ſoule, alſo its<note n="u" place="margin">Inheritance, owne Lands, <hi>or</hi> goods, <hi>or</hi> poſſeſſion.</note> Proprietary, and it is alſo a cauſe, that the<note n="x" place="margin">Or <hi>poore.</hi>
                        </note> meere ſoule altereth the Spirit according to the luſt of the body, or of the Spirit of this world.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Whereby the Image in the Spirit is altered altogether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Contence of the Will, which the ſoule hath<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>created,</hi> or <hi>formed.</hi>
                        </note> brought out of the Centre of Fire, alſo out of the Wrath into the Light, and all according to the Imagination.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. And, we give you to underſtand, that the Spirit<note n="z" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> in this time of the body.</note> while it ſtayes here in the body, can alter it ſelfe; which is done without its knowledge by the Imagination, <hi>viz.</hi> by the deſire of<note n="a" place="margin">Luſt-ſucht.</note> Luſt, ſo that the Deſiring figureth ſuch a forme in the will of the ſoule, as the luſt either to evill or good is.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. And we further ſay, that the meere ſoule is not corporeall, but in its Tincture, a body groweth whether it be a heavenly or a helliſh body, and yet is not a body which can be comprehended outwardly, but a vertuall body, the Divine body, Chriſts heavenly body, the heavenly fleſh: which he giveth us to eate in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. It is ſuch a body as the <hi>Turba</hi> cannot touch or apprehend, it is immortall and incorruptible, concluded in nothing but onely in the Noble Tincture, which is without<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                        </note> Eſſence, or Materiality; and that body is incomprehenſible to the outward fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. But the outward Spirit, (if the ſoule doe not hinder it but let it in,) bringeth its Imagination into it, and ſpoyleth it, ſo that another ſtrange Image commeth to be in the Spirit, in the Tincture according to the contence of the Luſt: as the Covetous commeth to be a Wolfe, the envious a Dog, the Proud a Horſe, Peacock or other Beaſt: alſo Toads, Adders, Serpents and other wormes, and creeping things; Now Gods Spirit receiveth not their Images, ſo long as they continue ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. And therefore Chriſt ſaid, ye muſt be borne anew of water and of the Spirit, if you would ſee the Kingdome of God: and therefore God became Man, brought the Divine Image againe into the Tincture of the ſoule, when it was ſpoyled in <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo that now we muſt be borne anew in Chriſt, if we will ſee God.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. And that alſo is done by the Imagination, or Faith; for Faith is an eating of the Divine Body, as alſo every body groweth by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. You know what is written in our third Booke, very punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at large, with many Circumſtances concerning its Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how <hi>Adam</hi> was created one Image, he was both Man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before <hi>Eve,</hi> he had both the Tincture of the fire, and of the water; that is, ſoule and Spirit, and he ſhould have brought forth his ſimilitude out of himſelfe, an Image<note n="e" place="margin">After, <hi>or</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording.</note> of himſelfe, out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his Imagination and his owne Love, and that he was able to doe without rending of the body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For, as we have mentioned before, the ſoule had<note n="f" place="margin">might <hi>or</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> power to change the body into another forme; and ſo alſo it had power to bring forth a Twig out of it ſelfe, according to its property, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood out in the<note n="g" place="margin">Proba, <hi>or</hi> Temptation.</note> Triall.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But when he imagined<note n="h" place="margin">In, <hi>or</hi> as, <hi>or</hi> with.</note> according to the Omnipotence, and let in the Spirit of this world into the Soule, and the Serpent into the Tincture, and tooke a longing in himſelfe after the Earthly fruite, to eate of evill and good, then alſo his Tincture conceived ſuch an Image as was halfe Earthly: <hi>viz.</hi> a Monſter, into which alſo the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> then inſtantly inſinuated it ſelfe, and ſought the limit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And ſo the Noble Image was found in the Earthly, and then deſtruction and Death began, and <hi>Adam</hi> could not<note n="i" place="margin">Beget, <hi>or</hi> beare.</note> bring forth, for his Omnipotence was loſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And ſhould indeed have ever been loſt, if the Heart of God had not inſtantly turned it ſelfe, with the word of the Promiſe into <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule; which did ſo preſerve it, that its Image muſt periſh,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61125:206"/> and the ſoule muſt ſinke downe with the Heavenly body through death into the new Life, where its Spirit will be renewed againe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And thus <hi>Adam</hi> in<note n="k" place="margin">Inability <hi>or</hi> weakneſſe.</note> impotence fell aſleep: and then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation began, for God tooke the Tincture of the Water; as a twig our of <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule, and a Rib out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and halfe of the Croſſe that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> and<note n="l" place="margin">

                     <p n="8">8. As you know that the woman hath the one halfe Croſſe in her head, and the man the other, for the ſpirit of the ſoule dwelleth in the Head, in the braine, out of which ſpirit God hath taken a Twig (<hi>viz.</hi> a Childe out of the ſpirit of the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi>) and hath given it to the woman.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And hath given the Tincture of the water to her, that ſhe ſhould not bring forth Devills, and the Man hath the Tincture of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the true Originall of Life.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And therefore the woman hath gotten the Matrix, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Man hath the Tincture of Fire: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the woman hath the Tincture of Light, which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Life, the life ariſeth in the Tincture of Fire.</p>
                     <p n="11">11.

                     <p n="12">12. Yet nevertheleſſe all the three Principles are in the ſeed, but the inward cannot be knowne by the outward: For in the ſeed the ſoule is not living; but when the two Tinctures come together, then it is a whole<note n="m" place="margin">Or <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. My beloved friend, you know well the heavie fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as we have ſhewen you copiouſly in all our writings, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſoule hath turned it ſelfe away with the right Eye, from God into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world, and is become diſobedient to God, and hath wholly depraved its Noble Image, and changed it into a monſtrous Image; and hath let in the Spirit of this world, whereas it ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ruled over it with the will, and not have let the ſoule eat of evill, and good at all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But now it hath plainely tranſgreſſed Gods<note n="c" place="margin">pleaſure.</note> Command, and hath put its Imagination into the Earthly Spirit, where the <hi>Turba</hi> which brought the Earthly Monſter into its Noble Image, inſtantly tooke it captive, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> inſtanly ſought, and found the Limit, in which the Image periſhed; and if the Word had not<note n="d" place="margin">Set it ſelfe in the middeſt.</note> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated, or interpoſed it ſelfe, it would have continued ſo for ever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And ſo, now the <hi>Turba</hi> is once ſeated in the Earthly Abyſſe, and hath captivated both body and ſoule, it alwayes driveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the limit, and there deſtroyeth it, and caſteth it away, and then the poore ſoule remaineth Naked without a Body.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And except it turne with its Right Eye againe into the Word, and get againe a body borne out of God, it is but naked, and hath the <hi>Turba</hi> in it; which ſtirreth up the fire in its great Anguiſh: for<note n="e" place="margin">

                     <p n="7">7. And although our ſoule get out, and become New-borne in

                     <p n="8">8. Alſo you know well; that the ſoule, wich the body in the ſeed, is halfe Earthy: for it is Sulphur, that is,<note n="g" place="margin">Phur is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Matter, <hi>or</hi> ſubſtance.</note> Phur and<note n="h" place="margin">Sul is Spirit, <hi>or</hi> Light.</note> Sul<note n="i" place="margin">In one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Turba</hi> is in it, which hath ability enough to deſtroy the ſeed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. How then can a ſoule be borne pure? It cannot be, it bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> with it into the world, and is ſinfull in the Mothers<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>body.</hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61125:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> then it becommeth borne againe, and ſo beommeth Gods Image.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, the <hi>Turba</hi> alſo mightily draweth the ſoule with its band, and continually bringeth the Earthly deſire into it, eſpecially in the youth; when the Earthly Tree ſticketh full of greene ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Eſſences and Poyſon: then the <hi>Turba</hi> doth ſo mightily inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it ſelfe, that many a ſoule is not freed to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In a thing which hath its riſe from two beginnings, being of equall weight, one part will ſinke downe, if weight be added to it, be it either good, or evill that is added.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sinne maketh not it ſelfe, but the will maketh it, it commeth from the Imagination into the Spirit: for the Spirit entreth into a thing, and is infected by that thing, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> of that thing commeth into the Spirit, and firſt deſtroyeth the Image of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And the <hi>Turba</hi> proceedeth further, and ſearcheth deeper, and ſo it findeth the Abyſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoule; and ſeeketh in the ſoule, and ſo findeth the wrathfull Fire, by which it mingleth it ſelfe with the thing, that is ſo introduced into the Spirit, and thus at length ſinne is wholly borne: Now therefore whatſoever deſireth to bring that which is outward into the Will, that is ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The will ought to incline to nothing, but to meekneſſe and Love, as if it were a Nothing, or Dead: wee ſhould only deſire to live to God, ſo that God may worke in us, and whatſoever wee doe beſides; our will muſt be directed ſo, that we doe it to God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But if we ſet our will upon the<note n="e" place="margin">Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>or</hi> earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride, Goods, Power, and Honour.</note> Eſſence, then wee bring the Eſſence into the Spirit, and that taketh poſſeſſion of our Heart: and then the <hi>Turba</hi> is borne, and the ſoule is captivated by the thing.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And therefore we <hi>Anſwer;</hi> that no ſoule commeth pure from the Mothers<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>body.</hi>
                        </note> wombe, be it begotten by holy or unholy Parents.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And is the Abyſſe and the Anger of God, and alſo the earthly world depend wholly on God the Father; and yet cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and touch his Heart and Spirit: ſo it is alſo with the Childe in the Mothers wombe, if it be begotten by godly Parents, then each Principle<note n="g" place="margin">

                     <p n="10">10. When the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh the earthly body, then the Heaven taketh the Spirit, and the Majeſty filleth the Spirit, and then the ſoule is in God, it is free from paine.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But while the ſoule remaineth in the Earthly Life, it is not free; becauſe the earthly Spirit doth with its Imagination, alwayes bring its Abominations into it; and the Spirit muſt continually be in ſtrife againſt the Earthly Life.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. WE have mentioned before, that there are three Principles, which are all three in the ſoule, already beforehand, and are in one another, as one thing: and you muſt underſtand that the ſtrife in the ſoule beginneth before, in the ſeed, while it lyeth hidden in both Sexes, in the Man and Woman; when alſo the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtirreth up it ſelfe before, in that it driveth the Eſſence of the ſeed to a falſe Imagination, to a falſe Deſire.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although the Spirit tameth the body, yet it imagineth, and this the <hi>Turba</hi> cauſeth in the ſeed, and no man can well deny, but that many times this Imagination is offenſive to him, and where there is a right Spirit, it wiſheth it<note n="h" place="margin">Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</note> anathematiſed: And you muſt know, that the ſpirit of the ſoule ſticketh thus in a miſerable ſtrait, and cannot be looſed, untill the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh the Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now there is never any union between the outward, and the Regenerate Man; the outward man would alwayes devoure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, for they are in one another, but each hath its owne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo that the outward cannot over-maſter the Inward, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doe but continue<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <p n="6">6. The Soule is the Pearle, and the Spirit of the ſoule is the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Pearle, and the Earthly Spirit is the ſeeker: the Earthly body is the<note n="m" place="margin">Myſterium.</note> Myſtery, wherein the<note n="n" place="margin">Arcanum.</note> ſecret of Greateſt<note n="o" place="margin">Or <hi>hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                        </note> abſtruſeneſſe is coucht: for the Deity hath manifeſted it ſelfe in the earthlineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in a comprehenſible Eſſence; and therefore now three Seekers belong thereto.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But you muſt not ſuppoſe, that we are an Enemie to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61125:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> life, for it is moſt profitable to us, as to the Wonders of God: there is nothing more profitable to the whole man, then to ſtand ſtill in his threefold Life, and not goe back at all with the outward into the Invard, but with the Inward into the outward.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For, the outward is a Beaſt, and belongeth not to the Inward; but its wonders which it hath brought forth out of the Inward, and which it hath opened in the comprehenſible Eſſence, they belong in their figure, (not in their Eſſence) to the Inward: the Inward Spirit muſt receive theſe (which are Gods workes of Wonder,) for they ſhall be the joy of it for ever.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And thus we ſay, that the ſoule may be kept very well in the New Man, if the Spirit of its Tincture, doe but hinder its<note n="p" place="margin">Seeking, <hi>or</hi> Deſire.</note> Longing and Imagination: and although the outward Spirit be beſtiall, yet the Inward underſtanding [Spirit] is able to keepe in, and tame the outward, for it is Lord over it: But he that ſuffereth the Beſtiall Spirit to be Lord, he is a Beaſt, and hath alſo a Beſtiall Image in the inward Figure, in the Tincture.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And he that letteth the Fire-Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Turba,</hi> be Lord, he is an<note n="q" place="margin">Subſtantiall, <hi>or</hi> Devill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canrate.</note> Eſſentiall Devill, in the Inward Image: therefore here it is neceſſary, that the outward Spirit powre<note n="r" place="margin">Viz. <hi>humility.</hi>

                     <p n="11">11. Now if we conſider our ſelves in the<note n="u" place="margin">Of the Old, and New man together.</note> union, the outward Spirit is very profitable to us, for many ſoules would periſh, if the Beſtiall Spirit were not: which beholdeth the Fire captive, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before the Fire-Spirit earthly beſtiall Labour and Joy, wherein it may buifie it ſelfe, till it be able by the<note n="x" place="margin">Or workes.</note> Wonders, in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to diſcover ſomewhat of its Noble Image, that it may ſeeke it ſelfe againe.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. My beloved Children, who are borne<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>of.</hi>
                        </note> in God, I tell it you: it was not for nothing, that God breathed the outward Spirit, (<hi>viz.</hi> the outward Life,) into <hi>Adams</hi> noſtrills: for great danger did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Image.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. God knew how it went with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and alſo what the great Eternall<note n="z" place="margin">

                     <p n="14">14. Alſo many a ſoule by its wickedneſſe would become a Devill in a<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p n="15">15. How many are there that are ſo full of poyſon, and<note n="b" place="margin">

                     <p n="17">17. Moreover, the outward Spirit could not have life without this Fire, ſeeing it hath fire in all Creatures, but this Fire is onely the wrath of the Inward fire.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The Inward fire conſumeth earth and ſtones, alſo the body and bloud, yea, even the Noble Image, if it be<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>kindled.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. MY beloved friend; you know well, that fire and water are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for the fire is Life, and the water is its Death, and you ſee plainely, that when water is poured upon the Fire, the ſource of the Fire goeth out, and ſo the Fire is dead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And although in Man [the fire] is not wholly dead becauſe of the Light, which continually cauſeth fire, yet there is an enmity; as there is an enmity between God and Hell; and yet Hell, or the Fire of wrath is Gods.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And Gods Majeſty would not be manifeſted, if his Anger were not, which ſharpneth the darke hiddenneſſe of Eternity, by the wrath of Nature, ſo that it is changed into Fire, whence the high Light in the free Eternity is brought forth, which maketh a Majeſty in the milde ſource.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And yet the Fire is the onely cauſe, that there is a<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>working.</hi>
                        </note> ſource in the Light, in the Meekneſſe; for the Light proceedeth from the Glance of the fire, and hath the ſource of the Fire in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But the Will (as is mentioned before) ſinketh downe in the Anguiſh, even into Death, and ſpringeth againe afreſh in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and this is the Light which hath the<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>property.</hi>
                        </note> ſource of the Fire; but yet it hath another Principle in it, for the Anguiſh is become Love.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After this manner alſo it is in the Body, where the fleſh ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61125:215"/> againſt the Spirit: the Life of the outward fleſh is a Glaſſe of the moſt Inward fire life, <hi>viz.</hi> of the life of the ſoule; and the life of the Spirit of the Soule, with the Light of the Tincture, is the middlemoſt Life, and yet it is borne out of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But underſtand our depth aright: the Spirit of the ſoule, wherein the Divine Image conſiſtech, ariſeth in the fire, and is firſt of all, the will to the Fire, but when the<note n="f" place="margin">

                        </note> another world thus commeth out of the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For, then the Will ſpringeth up in the other world, as a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of the Fire: yet it is without any ſuch<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>Aking property.</hi>
                        </note> Anguiſh ſource in the Eternall Liberty: and it is a moving, a driving and an<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>feeling.</hi>
                        </note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Anguiſhing Nature; it hath all the<note n="k" place="margin">

                        </note> Royall, and precious Image of God: for, God is thus, he is comprehended in the ſame ſource of Life.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Spirit is not parted from the ſoule, no, as you ſee Fire and Light are not parted, and yet are not one, they have a twofold<note n="m" place="margin">Or <hi>Quality.</hi>

                     <p n="11">11. And thus without much ſeeking you may finde, the cauſe of the Contrariety, that is between the fleſh and the Spirit: for, the inward Spirit hath the<note n="n" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> Gods body.</note> Divine Body from the meeke Eſſentiality, and the outward Spirit hath the Body of the Glaſſe, of the wrathfull Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the body of the Glaſſe of the ſoule, which would alwayes awaken the<note n="o" place="margin">Vehemency <hi>or</hi> fierceneſſe.</note> wrathfulneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Wonders which lie in the<note n="p" place="margin">In the ſecret, <hi>or</hi> hidden My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>

                     <p n="12">12. The Inward Spirit would be Maſter, for it tameth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo alſo the outward would be Maſter, for it ſaith, I have the Great Wonders, and the <hi>Arcanum,</hi> thus it braggeth of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and yet it is but a Glaſſe of the Myſterie.</p>

                     <p n="4">4.

Every ſoule rejoyceth before the face of God, in great hope of that which it ſhall receive againe, for it knoweth its Reward, but without the body it cannot receive it: for it hath wrought its workes in the Body, and therefore its workes follow it in the New body, and come to it againe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. For, although the exceeding precious Holy ſoules have put on Chriſts body in this world, ſo that they ſtand in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Image of God, yet all their workes were wrought in the Old Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was Gods Glaſſe: and in the Reſurrection, they ſhall be repreſented in the true heavenly Figure, in<note n="t" place="margin">

                     <p n="14">14. You muſt know that every bleſſed ſoule trimmeth its Lamp, ſo that it willingly meeteth its Bridegroome at the laſt Day: it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reneweth its will, and thinketh how it ſhall rejoyce with all holy men and Angels, in its new Body in the Wonders: there is a continuall ſpringing up of Joy in them, when they thinke of that which is to come, each as it's vertues are.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. And as their workes have been different upon Earth, ſo alſo is their hope: for, a Day-labourer, who hath wrought much, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at his wages; ſo alſo here: there is a friendly Eſſence among them, and in them.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. All the ſcorne and diſgrace which was put upon them that were innocent, is a great Triumphant Glory to them, in that they have ſuffered in Innocency, and put on Patience in Hope; which they have ſtill on, Death cannot take it away, nor put it off, but the ſoule taketh that with it which it hath<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>wrought.</hi>

                     <p n="17">17. Its many hearty Prayers, wiſhes, and good deedes in love to its Neighbour, are its food which it eareth, and joyfully enjoyeth,

                     <p n="23">23. O! that we had but a humane Pen, and were able to write it in the Spirit of your ſoule according to our knowledge: O! how many would then returne out of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> out of the Covetous, proud vale of Miſery, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is but Anguiſh and paine, full of feare, vexation and horrour.</p>

And here we ſhall let you know, that you may deeply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: what is the lamentable and miſerable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoules, and what they have to expect, and but briefly, ſeeing the following Queſtion doth it at large.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. Their expectation is like that of an impriſoned Malefactour, who continually liſtneth (when any thing ſtirreth) when the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner ſhould come, and execute Judgement, and give him his Reward: juſt ſo doe they.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. They have a falſe Conſcience, which gnaweth them, their ſins are ſet continually before them: they alſo ſee their workes Magical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they ſee all their unrighteouſneſſe and vanities, their unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride and haughtineſſe; they ſee the oppreſſion of the poore; their ſcorning and ſuppreſſion of them.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Their falſe beliefe flieth from them; their Hypocriſie was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61125:223"/> a deceitfull Glaſſe; it reached not the Heart of God; it ſtandeth viſibly before them in the Magick, <hi>viz.</hi> in their will: but when they ſearch therein, they ſtirre up the <hi>Turba</hi> of the Fire, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſume the Glaſſe, and then they are in feare and horrour.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. For, they ſee and know, that all muſt be tried at the laſt Day, by the Eternall fire of Gods Anger: and they feele very well that their workes will ſtay in the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. The Devills alſo exceedingly Tremble, when they conſider their fall: which reſts in Gods Judgement what he will doe; of which the Holy Scripture telleth us plainely enough: eſpecially the Judge, Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Thus know, that the totally miſerable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is, that when they ſhould trim their Lamps, to meete their Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome at his comming, they tremble and ſmother all their workes, which the <hi>Turba</hi> nevertheleſſe ſets before their Eyes.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. But now thoſe ſoules which are damned in a high degree, are very preſumptuouſly bold, they reject God, and curſe him, and are his<note n="h" place="margin">Moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> worſt Enemies.</p>

                     <head type="sub"> Whether doe the Soules of the wicked, without difference, (for ſo long a time before the Day of Judgement) feele any eaſe, or Refreſhment?</head>
                     <p n="1">1. A Thing which goeth into an Eternall Entrance, is alſo in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall End; who can put any thing into his hand that is a far off, and not preſent where it is to be done? he muſt give it onely into his hand that is by, to receive it: And that thing, which with its will is gone forth out of it ſelfe, can receive nothing within it ſelfe, becauſe it deſirerh nothing within it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thus it is with the wicked, in this world: he is gone with his will out of himſelfe into Covetouſneſſe, Pride and pleaſure, into vices, gormandizing, tipling and whoring, alſo into Gluttony: his will is continually bent to diſpiſe the poore; in ſcorne and diſgrace to plague the poore, and to tread him downe by Authority.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He hath corrupted Judgement with lies and bribes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſwallowed downe unrighteouſneſſe as a Cow drinketh water; all that hath come from him hath been<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>cruell.</hi>
                        </note> bitter Anger, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as farre as his power would reach: his will hath been meere wilfulneſſe, he hath done what he liſted; he hath danced after the Devills owne Pipe, and hath wholly entred into Covetouſneſſe; he hath accounted his money and meanes, his Treaſure; and his will hath continually entred into it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He hath never retired into himſelfe, and ſought after Love, much leſſe humility; he hath eſteemed the needy, as his footſtoole, he hath cruſhed him under without meaſure: he hath counted it his Art and wit, when he hath been able thus to gripe and over-reach the ſimple; and deprive him of his labour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He hath ſuppoſed, that he had found out the fineſt policy, who<note n="m" place="margin">Had gotten an Office.</note> could contrive his buſineſſe ſo ſure, that he might doe what he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, then he thought himſelfe very cunning, and that he had great Wiſdome.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. All this, yea, and much more he hath conceived in his will, and therewith the Image of the Spirit of the ſoule hath been filled, and all this ſtandeth in his figure; and when ever the body<note n="n" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> returnes to Earth.</note> dieth, then the <hi>Turba</hi> layeth hold of this in the Spirit.</p>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61125:224"/>7. And then if the Spirit would faine enter into it ſelfe, the <hi>Turba</hi> goeth with it, and ſeeketh the ground, <hi>viz.</hi> the Roote of the ſoule, and ſo the fire is but<note n="o" place="margin">Inflamed.</note> kindled by it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And you muſt know, that the ſoules of the wicked have no eaſe, their beſt eaſe and joy is when they climbe up in the will, in their<note n="p" place="margin">Employment, <hi>or</hi> Office.</note> workes which they did here, and continually deſire to doe them more ſtill: it grieveth them that they did not afflict the honeſt more then they did; their will is juſt ſo as it was here.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They are Spirits of Pride, like the Devill, a Covetous devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirit, which devoureth their abominations which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here: their joy is onely to thinke how they will contemne God, and be their owne Lords, this is their recreation and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no other.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. For, how ſhould they receive any other refreſhing? when they dare not for ſhame lift up their eyes to God, nor dare they flie to the Saints, whom they have here ſcorned; they are aſhamed to doe that, for their falſhood continually ſmiteth them on the face, and their malice and falſhood boyleth tip from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. When but the leaſt thought of the laſt Day, commeth into their mindes, then feare and horrour ſtirreth in them: they rather let that thought alone, and recreate themſelves in haughtineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And this is alſo a Wonder, and the greateſt Wonder of All, that an<note n="q" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> an Image of Love.</note> Angell ſhould become ſuch a furious<note n="r" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> mad ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Image of Anger, and wrath.</note> Devill: and ſo the Power of Gods Anger commeth to be manifeſt in God: for God hath manifeſted himſelfe according to both<note n="ſ" place="margin">The Eye of Love, and the Eye of wrath.</note> Eyes, in Love and Anger: and it is left free to Man, he may goe into which of them he will: God throweth none into wrath, the ſoule caſteth it ſelfe into it.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But you muſt know, that the wrath hath ſet its<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>Jawes.</hi>
                        </note> throat wide open, and draweth mightily, and deſireth to devoure All; for it is the Covetouſneſſe, and the Pride inſulting over humility.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And ſo alſo Love and Humility have opened their Mouth; and draw with all their Powers, and would draw Man into Love, into Heaven.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. Yet we confeſſe, and acknowledge readily that the Church of Chriſt hath great power to ranſome ſuch a ſoule; if with fervency and Earneſtneſſe it doe it: as it was done in the Primitive Church, when they had holy people, and Holy Prieſt, who performed their Miniſtry in reall Earneſtneſſe.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. But the boſome of <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be underſtood thus: <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of all the Faithfull; and God gave him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that in his ſeed all people ſhould be bleſſed; this was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Meſſia Chtiſt, who would become man in the<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>Beleevers.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Now this is the Holy Chriſtian Church, borne in Chriſt; and that is the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for we are All one Body in Chriſt; and the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham:</hi> He is the Patriarch, we are all borne in the ſame Promiſe, (we meane [by] the New Birth in Chriſt) and are in the ſame boſome, which receiveth us.</p>

And thus; in Humility; we are with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the boſome of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for Chriſt is <hi>Abraham:</hi> Chriſt was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and now he hath him, and wee alſo: and ſo we come into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and are his Children in the Promiſe, and Chriſt is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it, and we in the fulfilling are in the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith and Spirit.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Children drowned ſinne in their bloud by Faith in Chriſt, who ſhould become Man in their bloud; and now it is fulfilled: and therefore God hath ſet the ſeale of Faith<note n="a" place="margin">That is in the Eſſence, <hi>or</hi> in the water.</note> in the ſubſtance; and now we muſt be, and are Regenerated in the true bloud of Chriſt.</p>

Wee were ſtrangers, and muſt worke in his houſe; yet the Lord did promiſe us in Paradiſe, that he would againe freely out of Grace, give us his Kingdome: He rejected <hi>Caines</hi> offering, but he gave the Kingdome of grace to <hi>Abell;</hi> for <hi>Abell</hi> ſought it in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and <hi>Caine</hi> in the worke.</p>

Now ſeeing you doe ſo vehemently long after the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſeeke them with ſo earneſt a Deſire, yet giving God the glory accounting your ſelfe unworthy in your high Art, and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelfe before God: therefore God giveth you them, by ſo meane and poore an Inſtrument, who eſteemeth himſelfe much more unworthy of them; but yet would not willingly ſtrive againſt his will: and ſo you are the cauſe that this hand findeth and attaineth them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For, this hand knew nothing of the Myſterie: It ſought onely
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61125:228"/> for the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the underſtanding of <hi>Abraham</hi> was alſo given unto it, which you have cauſed by your ſeeking.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now have a care, that you alſo obtaine the Spirit of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which hath written in the knowledge of this hand, wee will impart it to you as a brother: for wee are not your Lord in this hidden thing, but your ſervant.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Know us aright, we are <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and you may be accounted <hi>Abraham</hi> in compariſon of us; you have laboured much more then we; but we are fallen into your Harveſt: nor of merit, but by the Grace of the Giver: leaſt any tongue ſhould boaſt in the ſight of God, and ſay, this hath my underſtanding done.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You propound a deep Queſtion,<note n="f" place="margin">
                           <hi>Viz.</hi> in his outward Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>or</hi> in the Old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </note> I underſtand it not: for if I ſhould underſtand it, then I ſhould dwell in the ſeparated ſoule, and muſt have the very ſame ſpirit, and knowledge of that ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But now ſeeing we are one body in Chriſt, we have all of us Chriſts Spitit; therefore in Chriſt we all ſee out of one Spirit, and have one knowledge; for he is become man in us, and all holy ſoules are our fellow-members, all begotten out of one: and we all have one will in Chriſt, in the true boſome of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And now we have obtained ſtrength to reveale this hidden thing to you in Chriſt; for our ſoules ſeeth in their ſoule; not as if they came to us, but we goe to them: for they are in perfection, and we but<note n="g" place="margin">In part, <hi>or</hi> in imperfection.</note> in part.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And now we are able to anſwer you, not from the reaſon of the outward world; but from the Image in Chriſt, and from his and our Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. You aske, whether the ſeparated ſoules take care of humane matters, and allow, or diſallow them? Now this you muſt underſtand to be in three different manners, concerning three ſeverall ſorts of ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Firſt, thoſe ſoules, which yet have not attained Heaven, and ſo ſtick in the ſource, in the Principle, in the Birth, thoſe have yet the humane Eſſence with the workes in them: they diligently ſearch out the cauſe of their<note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> ſtay in that condition.</note> Retention.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And therefore many of them come againe with the Aſtrall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wander up and downe in their houſes and places of abode, and appeare in a humane Shape, and deſire this and that, and oftentimes take care about their wills or Teſtaments, and alſo thinke to procure the bleſſing of the Saints, that they may reſt: and if their Earthly affaires doe ſtill ſtick in them, they take care many times alſo about their Children and friends.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This condition of theirs continueth ſo long, till they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Reſt; and till their Aſtrall Spirit be conſumed; then all ſuch doings, care, and perplexities are at an end, and rhey alſo have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61125:228" rendition="simple:additions"/> no more knowledge thereof, but that they ſee them meerely in the Wonders, in the Magick.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. But it ſtirreth not the <hi>Turba,</hi> neither ſeeketh what is in this world: for, it being once paſſed through Death from the <hi>Turba,</hi> it deſireth ſuch things no more; It alſo taketh no further care: for care ſtirreth up the <hi>Turba,</hi> and then the will of the Soule ſhould be forced to enter with its Spirit into earthly things; but it had rather let ſuch things alone, becauſe it hardly got rid of them before; It will no more entertaine the Earthly will.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. This is an Anſwer concerning this firſt ſort, and wee tell you plainely, and in Truth; that this ſort (after they are once received into Grace) take no more care purpoſely about humane Earthly<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>affaires.</hi>
                        </note> matters: but it beholdeth the heavenly matters, which are brought to it by the Spirit of man, and rejoyceth in them; but there is ſomewhat ſtill behinde, which is this.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. A living man hath ſuch Power, that he is able with his Spirit, to goe into Heaven to the ſeparated ſoules, and ſtirre them up about ſome Queſtion by a hearty Deſire: but it muſt be earneſt, it muſt be Faith, that can breake open a Principle.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And this we ſee in <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet, whom the<note n="k" place="margin">Saul.</note> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> raiſed up: that he might make his will knowne to him: though this ſeeme otherwiſe to ſome: of whom we may well ſay, that they are blinde and voyde of knowledge, for they ſpeake but their owne ſcholaſtick Fables, and frame Opinions about that they have no knowledge of in the Spirit: and theſe are <hi>Babell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. Now ſecondly, the other ſort, which ſinke into Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a<note n="l" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> the body of Chriſt.</note> body, they are wholly in one, and the ſame place of the Principle, in which the firſt ſort are, which afterward did ſinke downe in themſelves: All theſe take no evill affaires upon them, wherein the <hi>Turba</hi> ſticketh.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. But when the honeſt ſoules which are alive, ſend them their workes, with their Spirit and will, they rejoyce in them, and are ſo affable, that they appeare to men Magically in ſleepe, and ſhew them good wayes, and many times reveale Arts which lye in<note n="m" place="margin">

                     <p n="20">20. For, ſeeing the Earthly Spirit thruſteth its Myſterie before the ſoule, and keepeth the ſoule captive in that Myſterie, therefore the Spirit of the Soule cannot alwayes attaine the deepeſt ſecrets; but after the departure of the body, the ſoule is naked, and that eſpecially, if it be without a New body; then it beholdeth it it ſelfe, and alſo its Wonders: and it can very well ſhew one that is living ſomewhat (if he be honeſt and have not ſtirred up the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>) in the ſleeping <hi>Magia:</hi> for Dreames are wholly Magicall, and the ſoule without a Body is in the <hi>Magia</hi> of God.</p>

                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61125:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>21. Thus know that no ſoule ſeparated from the body entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any wicked matter, except it be a damned ſoule, which indeed entreth in Magically, and hath its joy therein, and teacheth moſt notorious vile prancks in Dreames, for it is a ſervant of the Devill.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And whatſoever a wicked man deſireth, that the Devill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily helpeth him to; for he can doe it better by the ſoule of a man then of himſelfe, for he is too crude, and<note n="n" place="margin">Makes hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the <hi>Magia.</hi>

                     <p n="23">23. Alſo you muſt know this, that all is done Magically in the will, without<note n="p" place="margin">Raiſing of the paine, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</note> awakening of the ſource: no ſoule riſeth with its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of its owne accord to pleaſe Man; unleſſe man raiſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe it himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. There are many villanies in Nigromancy, which can many times vex and torment the Spirits of men; but it can doe ſo to no ſoule, that is cloathed with Chriſts Eſſentiality; for, that ſoule is free.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The third ſort of ſeparated ſoules, which are in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in Chriſt, having the heavenly Eſſentiality, none can ſtirre them, except they will themſelves, as when they beare a favour to a ſoule that is like themſelves: alſo they take no Earthly thing upon them, except it maketh for the Glory of God, and then they are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to reveale ſomething in a Magicall manner.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. But they let no <hi>Turba</hi> into them; neither doe they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God for us; but whatſoever commeth to them they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, with the Angels: for, the Angels rejoyce at a ſinner that repenteth; then much more, the ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Why ſhould they pray to God for us? it lyeth not in their Prayer; but in mans entring into God; when he ſtrongly turneth his will to God, then Gods Spitit helpeth him without<note n="q" place="margin">Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>or</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</note> Prayers.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. For, his Armes are ſtretched forth day and night to help Man; what need is there then of their Prayers? It is the will of God that man ſhould come to him.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Shall then a<note n="r" place="margin">A ſeparated ſoule of a Saint.</note> ſoule be ſo preſumptuous as to make God ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Judge, as not to be willing to receive a returning ſinner? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no true knowledge of God were in this: But when they ſee the ſoule pierce in with its Spirit to God; it is great joy to them that Gods Kingdome is enlarged.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. The heavenly ſoule hath Gods will: what God willeth, that it willeth alſo; but it is Gods Spirit it ſelfe that will help the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The ſoules ſee well how Gods Spirit pierceth into the ſoule, if the will of the ſoule doe but give way to it: there is no neede of the Prayers of any<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                     <p n="33">33. The Faith of one receiveth the Faith of another, the Faith of the living tooke hold of the Faith of the Saints departed, and the<note n="u" place="margin">

                     <p n="34">34. Yea it is ſo powerfull, that it can throw downe Mountaines! ſhall then the pure Faith of the Saints in the Faith of the living be able to doe nothing? Indeed it could even<note n="x" place="margin">

This is even done by the Holy Ghoſt, who hath wrought the Wonders by the Faith of both parties; and they are onely the Wonders of God, and of his Children-</p>
                     <p n="37">37. But this is wholly caſt to the ground, and now there is ſo learned a Schoole, that it contemneth all Gods<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>Miracles.</hi>

For, now Death commeth thereby: and in that houre, all Creatures, except man, ſhall die: alſo all men that have crept into the Rocks and Mountaines ſhall come forth, but with anguiſh of their Conſcience (although as yet the <hi>Turba</hi> hindred ſo, that the horrour was in Death;) for, the falling of the water doth captivate the <hi>Turba.</hi>

                     <p n="46">46. This voyce is the originall, Eternall Spirit, which upholdeth every life, and which alſo hath alwayes governed in all the three Principles: for, it is that Spirit, whence the life of every thing hath

                     <p n="48">48. For, in the Creation he moved the Father; and in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sonne, and now the laſt moving, and the Judgement is his: he will reduce every thing to its Eternall abode; and this is done by the voyce of the word proceeding from the Mouth of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. For, the Spirit goeth forth in two Principles in God: that is, in the Anger or Fire, he goeth forth as the earneſt wrath of the Fire-life; in the light of the Love he goeth forth as a flame of the Divine Majeſtie; and in the Spirit of this world he goeth forth as a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Life; and all this is undeniable.</p>

And if perhaps ſome perſon would arrogate ſuch exceeding high Learning to himſelfe, as to gaineſay it, to him we offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it, in every thing, we will except nothing in this world: every thing will afford an evident Teſtimony of it: let him come to us when he will: he ought not to put it off, and ſay, we are mad: for if theſe few words will not ſatisfie him, we will ſo evidence it to him, that he himſelfe ſhall finde and ſee who himſelfe is: yes though the Devill himſelfe ſhould burſt for very Anger, yet we would ſet it downe plainely before his eyes.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. Now ſeeing this Spirit hath the word <hi>Fiat, (viz.</hi> Gods word,) and the Center of Nature, whence it hath its Eternall Originall; and as the Spirit of the Center hath a twofold Effluence (the firſt being in the Fire, in the Eſſences of the Originall of Life, in the ground of the Origînall of the ſoule: and the ſecond in the light of the Fire, which is the ſecond<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>Property.</hi>

And therefore it will breake open the Gates of Death, for it ſhall raiſe the Dead: and it hath the word <hi>Fiat</hi> in it, and this <hi>Fiat</hi> is both in the ſoule, and in the body alſo; and although the body have been long corrupted, yet the <hi>Turba</hi> remaineth ſtill in the <hi>Fiat</hi> with the Wonders of the body.</p>

                     <p n="56">56.

                     <p n="2">2. You know, that God is become Man, and hath taken our Fleſh and bloud, and ſoule upon him: Now Chriſt ſaid,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Joh. 8.23.</note> 
                        <hi>I am from above:</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Doe you underſtand this, that he ſaid, he is in Heaven? He ſpake not onely of his Deity, that is, of the Word; but of the Sonne of Man, even of that Word which was fleſh; and this we are now to conſider of: for, in that Fleſh and Bloud we muſt live Eternally, and we muſt have Chriſts body, if we will ſubſiſt in God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yet wee know of no other body that we have, but our<note n="u" place="margin">Job. 19.26, 27.</note> owne body, growing out of the Old Body, as a ſprout groweth from a kernell: and ſuch a Body <hi>Adam</hi> had in the Creation; but he was captivated by the<note n="x" place="margin">

                     <p n="5">5. Now we know well that <hi>Adam</hi> was a chaſte Virgine before his ſleep, and before <hi>Eve</hi> was made, but afterwards became a Man,<note n="z" place="margin">That is a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall animall mortall man.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Deformity like a beaſt, of which we are yet aſhamed at this very day in the ſight of God, becauſe wee have Earthly beſtiall members for propagation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now <hi>Adam</hi> had the Virgine of Divine Wiſdome in him, but when he fell, then it continued immoveable in its owne Principle, and <hi>Adam</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. But know that Chriſt became Man in that Virgine [which was] in the Earthly <hi>Mary;</hi> for the word of the Lord brought it with it into the body of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And here you muſt underſtand, that Chriſt became Fleſh in the water of Eternall Life; (which fleſh the whole Deity filleth;) and alſo in the<note n="b" place="margin">Subſtance, <hi>or</hi> properties.</note> Eſſences of the Earthly <hi>Mary.</hi>

                        <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> he muſt therefore receive <hi>Mary's</hi> Fleſh, yet in the bleſſing, in the Heavenly Virgine onely.</p>
                     <p n="11">11.

                     <p n="12">12. That word which became Fleſh had the water of Eternall Life, which did proceed from the Divine Majeſty, and yet it was in <hi>Mary's</hi> bloud: and here for further information wee direct you to our third Booke; where it is deſcribed at large.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. And thus we tell you, we ſhall have a body conſiſting of Fleſh and bloud, ſuch a body as Chriſt had; for Chriſt by his Incarnation is<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>borne.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. When we are borne anew of water, and of the Spirit, then in Chriſts Spirit, we are borne anew of Chriſts fleſh and bloud, wee put on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Chriſt becommeth borne in the converted ſinner, and he in Chriſt becommeth the Childe of God, this is the body wee ſhall have in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. No groſſe beaſtiall fleſh, as we have in the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile fleſh and bloud, ſuch fleſh as can paſſe through wood, and ſtone, they remaining whole ſtill; as Chriſt came in to his Diſciples the doore being ſhut: It is ſuch a body as hath no <hi>Turba</hi> or fragility, Hell cannot retaine it, it is like Eternity: and yet it is reall fleſh and bloud, which our heavenly hands ſhall touch, and feele, and take hold of, alſo a viſible Body as that is, which we have here in this world.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Now pray conſider; how is it poſſible that ſuch a body as we carry about us here, can be<note n="f" place="margin">Comprehend, <hi>or</hi> receive.</note> capable of the Divine Majeſty? ſure it muſt be ſuch a body, as is like the Majeſtie, that the Majeſtie can ſhine forth from it, out of the Tincture and water of Eternall Life.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Here indeed we are as it were<note n="g" place="margin">

                     <p n="19">19. Therefore we ſay, that we ſhall have the Divine Body and Chriſts body which filleth Heaven: wee ſhall not remaine in that which is his Creature: but be joyned one to another as members, brethren and Children.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. If we would conſider the ſoule of Chriſt, we need onely ſeeke and finde our ſelves: for Chriſts ſoule is a humane ſoule, conceived in <hi>Mary</hi> the<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p n="4">4. Yet we doe not acknowledge the outward mortall Life in <hi>Mary</hi> for a pure Virgine: for, that which is mortall hath the Anger and the <hi>Turba</hi> which corrupteth all Purity, ſo that no pure Virgine is borne of <hi>Eve,</hi> but are all daughters of her.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And <hi>Eve</hi> her ſelfe was but halfe a Virgine, for <hi>Adam</hi> was the other halfe, according to the two Tinctures, in which man ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be wholly a Virgine in pure Love, and ſo ſaw God through himſelfe, that is, through the Creature he ſaw the Originall, which produced thoſe two out of it ſelfe.</p>

                     <p n="8">8.

                     <p n="9">9. And the <hi>(Eve)</hi> inſtantly ſet her Imagination upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo both were mutually kindled with the Deſire of each other.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Where is now the pure Chaſtity and Modeſty? is it not beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? is not the outward Image become a Beaſt? as is to be ſeene plaine enough in his Will and<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>doings.</hi>
                        </note> Eſſence, that he doth like a Beaſt, yea, more fooliſhly, for he hath Reaſon, and yet runneth on againſt Reaſon, as if he were voyde of ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But that he might be reſtored, and the Image reduced into Unity, that word which ſpake the ſoule out of the Mouth of God, and did breath it from the Holy-Ghoſt into the Image, is become Man, and is entred into the Earthly Image, that is, into the <hi>Turba</hi> of Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61125:243"/>12. And you know very well, that the word hath the water of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life, and the Fire, the Deity, and out of the Fire [it hath] the Tincture of the Deity, and in the Tincture, the Spirit of God, which proceedeth from the Mouth of God; and in the proceeding forth the<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>Luſter.</hi>
                        </note> glance of the Majeſty is made manifeſt in the operation of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This word which is in the Virgine of the wiſdome of God, and encompaſſed with the Wonders of Eternity, is now in humility of great Love towards our Image which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> come againe into us, and is in Mary (underſtand the Earthly <hi>Mary,</hi> yet in the Benediction) become Man.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Benediction was, that the ſoule of <hi>Mary</hi> was adorned with the heavenly Virgine of the wiſdome of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt; therefore the Angell called her bleſſed of all Women.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. No woman from <hi>Adam</hi> to that Time was ever cloathed with the heavenly Virgine but this <hi>Mary:</hi> therefore by the bleſſing ſhe became chaſte and full of Purity: for the Holy Ghoſt goeth not into that which is Earthly, he mixeth himſelfe not with the<note n="h" place="margin">Similitude, <hi>or</hi> Reſemblance.</note> Glaſſe, for it cannot be that the Glaſſe ſhould be as the Life it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Underſtand our high and precious depth thus; The ſoule of Man proceedeth from God, and is from the Eternall; and the body of man is but a Glaſſe of the Eternall, and ſo God cloathed the ſoule of <hi>Mary</hi> with the Divine Virgine, in the Principle of the ſoule; not in the Earthly fleſh; as if ſhe had been deified: no! ſhe muſt die as well as all other people.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And in this Virgine, Gods word, out of the Heart of God the Father aſſumed the ſeed of the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeed of the ſoule, and the ſeed of the firſt Image, which for ſo long a time ſtood hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Myſtery.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But now at length, the Life of God entred into it, and did make it a whole Image againe: for, the water of Eternall life proceeding from the Heart of God, mingled with the water of the Spirit of the ſoule: for the Spirit taketh its Originall from the water, and the ſoule is Fire.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Thus the word received the Tincture of the ſoule, and the Holy Ghoſt the Tincture of the Spirit <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and both became one ſoule: and yet the Creature was ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Gods Spirit, though Gods Spirit dwelt therein: and of Gods water and Tincture, and of the ſeed of <hi>Mary,</hi> from her Tincture and water, in the high benediction, a fleſh and bloud was produced, ſo that an Heavenly Man in the Earthly was incarnate at once.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. So that it may be ſaid; this is the Sonne of the Woman; <hi>viz.</hi> the very bodily and naturall Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> with ſoule and body,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61125:244" rendition="simple:additions"/> with fleſh and bloud, and all that belongeth unto Man: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the very Sonne of God, which was borne from Eternity out of Gods Eternall Eſſence, ere the foundation of the world was layd; who ſtood both in the Majeſty of the Holy Ternary, and alſo in the<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>wombe.</hi>
                        </note> body of <hi>Mary</hi> at once.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. And the ſoule of Chriſt doth belong halfe to the Principle of this world, and halfe to the Holy Ghoſt: for, the ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of Chriſt uſed the Spirit of the Aire and Starres, with the vertue of the Elements; and alſo the Word of God and the Divine food; for ſuch a man <hi>Adam</hi> was in his Innocency.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Thus God hath regenerated us in Chriſt; and ſo we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in Chriſt out of Gods word and Spirit, by the water of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life, and ſo we are Gods Children in Chriſt: and if we reſigne our ſelves up to Chriſt, departing from our Reaſon and will, then we put on Chriſts body, and our will and Spirit liveth from Chriſt, who is in us and we in him.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Hence you may underſtand what the Temptation of Chriſt was, <hi>viz.</hi> The Regenerate man was to endure <hi>Adams</hi> Temptation [to trie] whether his ſoule could ſtand ſtedfaſt in God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was proved in the <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. And the other two Temptations were theſe, viz. he was tempted [to trie] whether man would live in<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>compleat.</hi>
                        </note> full obedience, and ſuffer God to worke in him; or whether he would exalt himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and be free from God, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did? therefore the Devill muſt tempt him, becauſe this man was to poſſeſſe his Royall Throne.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The Devill complained that he could not ſtand, becauſe the Mother of wrathfulneſſe did draw h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m too hard, and therefore he was permitted to trie this man, and to ſet before him that which was ſet before himſelfe; and if this man ſtood, then he ſhould judge the Devill, who was found to be a lyar.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. For he full tried him in the ſecond and third temptation, whether he would aſcend on high, in his owne power, as himſelfe had done, and ſo ſtirred up the Anger: or whether he would put his truſt and affiance in God onely, and live to him both in will and deede; as a childe in obedience to the Father, and this he urged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, juſt ſo long as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the Temptation, before he fell aſleep.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. And now wee alſo muſt alwayes be ſo tempted and proved:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61125:244" rendition="simple:additions"/> and we are able to get the victory in Chriſt who hath overcome: for his ſoule is our ſoule, and his fleſh is our fleſh, if we truſt in him, and give up our ſelves wholly to him as Chriſt gave up himſelfe to his Father.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. And thus my beloved friend, you underſtand what Chriſts ſoule and body is; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is our ſoule and body if wee cleave to God; but if we doe not, then we are parted; and in the outward life, we belong to the Spirit of this world, <hi>viz.</hi> to the loſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed <hi>Adam;</hi> and in the ſoule wee belong to the Devill in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God: but looke for theſe things more at large in our other writings; where you ſhall finde the whole ground of Heaven, and of this world.</p>

Now when wee ſpeake of Chriſts Spirit, Reaſon thinketh it is the ſoule, or elſe the Spirit of the outward Life, which conſiſteth in the vertue and operation of the Starres and Elements, but it is not ſo; It is ſomewhat elſe wherein the Image of God conſiſteth: the outward Spirit belongeth not to the Deity, but to the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wee have ſpoken ſomewhat of it already: but becauſe this Queſtion doth put us in minde of it againe; mentioning that when he dyed, he commended it to his Father; therefore we muſt a little ſay how that was done.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. You ſufficiently perceive in what manner the ſoule is the<note n="x" place="margin">Centrum Naturae.</note> Center of Nature, the Originall of Life, and mobility, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Fire: which ſhould be continually converted into the Eternall will of God, wherein it is originally borne from the Magicall Deſire, and is a great Secret come out of the Eternall Nothing, wherein all things are contained, even the Deity with all the three Principles, and every<note n="y" place="margin">Thing, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>or</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Being that can be named.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And you perceive that the Light and Spirit of the Aire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the fire, and alſo that the fire doth againe draw the Spirit, of the Aire into it ſelfe, and ſo alwayes bloweth it ſelfe up; and ſo with the Light, Aire, and<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>property.</hi>
                        </note> ſource of the Fire it is its owne Life.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And further, wee have ſaid ſomewhat of the Noble Tincture which ariſeth in the Light, in which the meekneſſe of the Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and it commeth forth from the Anguiſh which is as a mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpringeth forth afreſh through the mortifying Anguiſh, as a life having another<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>Source.</hi>
                        </note> property, where the property of the fire is a kinde of Tincture, like the driving forth of a Spirit; and yet it is deſiring, and thereby it attracteth the vertue of the Light into it ſelfe, and maketh it an Eſſence, <hi>viz.</hi> water.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And therein are two Formes: One according to the ſource of Fire which is red, and therein the vertue, <hi>viz. Sulphur;</hi> And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is like a thin meekneſſe, yet having Eſſentiality,) is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which the deſiring Tincture contracteth together into one, and changeth it into Bloud.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Now the Originall in the Bloud, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire (which is a warmth, that is, a Tincture) is a Life; and in the vertue of the Tincture, the thin water of the Life proceedeth, one<note n="b" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> vertue proceeding forth from<note n="c" place="margin">The inward.</note> another; and the vertue doth alwayes reaſſume that which goeth forth: and that which is gone forth is free from the Fire, and alſo from the vertue, for it is gone forth, and yet it aroſe from the vertue.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. But ſeeing this Spirit ariſeth firſt out of the Center of Nature, that is, out of the Life of Fire, (although it is not the life of the Fire, but the Spirit of it, and the Life of the Fire ſtandeth originally in the Abyſſe, în the ſource of Gods Anger) therefore Chriſt did not commend this Spirit of his to the fires owns life, but into the hands of his Father.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. His hands are the Love-Deſire, wherewith he embraceth our Spirit, when we enter into him, and commend our ſelves to him.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. For, when his body was to dye on the Croſſe; and his ſoule was to paſſe through Hell, through the Anger of God; there the Devills waited, and thought with themſelves, we will ſurely keep the ſoule in our <hi>Turba</hi> in the Fire; and then Chriſt commended the Spirit into the Love of God.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And ſo the ſoule of Chriſt with the Spirit came into Gods hand, being encompaſſed with the Fire of Anger and Death: and Death would have held it there, but Death was deſtroyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. For, Death ſmothered the outward [Spirit] <hi>viz.</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Life, and then thought, now ſurely the ſoule muſt remaine in the <hi>Turba:</hi> but there was one, ſtronger in the ſoule; <hi>viz.</hi> the word of God: which tooke death captive, and deſtroyed the Anger, and quenched the wrath with the Love in the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. It was a poyſon to Hell, for the Love of God to come into it, and ſmother it in the ſoule alſo a Plague, Death and Deſtruction to Death; Death muſt now ſuffer an Eternall Life to grow in it.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Thus the Spirit of Chriſt tooke the Divell captive, and drave him out of the Fire of the ſoule, and caſt him into Darkneſſe: and ſhut him up under darkneſſe, out from the Fire of the ſoule, and out from Gods Fire; into the wrathfull harſhneſſe and bitterneſſe in cold: there let him warme himſelfe leaſt he freeze with cold.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Conſider the firſt foure Formes of Nature, and you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the Devills Manſion is: for, before Chriſt [came] he kept the ſoule captive in the <hi>Turba,</hi> with the Fire; and although he had not the Spirit of the ſoule, yet he had the root of it in the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba:</hi> but then he was commanded to ceaſe; and he was throwne out, and driven into Darkneſſe, and thus his malice was deſtroyed by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61125:246"/> Chriſts deſcending into Hell, and Chriſt became his Judge.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Thus we have in briefe deſcribed what the Spirit of Chriſt, and our Spirit is; <hi>viz.</hi> not the outward Spirit, but the Spirit of the ſoule; not the ſoule it ſelfe, but the Spirit of its Life.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. As, in God, the Holy Ternary, is diſtinct, being three Perſons in one Eſſence, and yet but one onely God; where the Sonne hath the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Life, iſſuing forth from the Heart and mouth; and the Heart is the flame of Love; and the Father the<note n="e" place="margin">Fountaine, <hi>or</hi> Property.</note> ſource of Anger, which is made meeke, by the Sonne, in the Love, ſo that in God there is but one onely will and Eſſence.</p>

                     </note> compriſed the ſoule, by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Eternall will of the Father, in the Center of the Eternall Nature: and opened it with the Holy Ghoſt, or blew it up like a fire (which lay hid in the Eternity, and wherein all formes of the eternall Nature ſtood from Eternity:) and<note n="r" place="margin">The ſoule, <hi>or</hi> the formes.</note> is alone known in the wiſdome, in the Divine <hi>Magia</hi> as a figure, or Image without ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet that<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>being.</hi>
                     </note> thing hath not been ſubſtantiall, but Eſſentiall, and hath been knowne in the Principle, in the flaſh, where the fire ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; But the ſhadow of it hath (from Eternity in a figurative Image,) figured it ſelfe in the Deſiring will of God; and hath ſtood<note n="t" place="margin">Or in the preſence of the Ternary.</note> before the Ternary of God in the <hi>Magia</hi> in the wiſdome of God, as a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Holy Trinity: in which, God hath manifeſted himſelfe as in a Glaſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſubſtance and Image of the ſoule, may be reſembled to the Earth, having a faire flower growing out of it, and alſo to the fire and Light: as we ſee that Earth is a<note n="u" place="margin">Ground, foundation, <hi>or</hi> ſoyle, <hi>or</hi> the Mother of that which groweth upon it.</note> Center, but no Life; yet it is Eſſentiall: and a faire flower groweth out of it, which is not like Earth, neither hath it the ſmell and taſte of the Earth, much leſſe the figure of it: and yet the Earth is the Mother of the flower.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And ſo the ſoule alſo<note n="x" place="margin">ſhone.</note> appeared out of the Eternall Center of Nature, out of the Eternall Eſſence, with the word <hi>Fiat</hi> in the will of God; and was held in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> ſo that it<note n="x" place="margin">ſhone.</note> appeared as a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eye, and ſimilitude of the firſt Principle in a creaturely forme, and ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And from this Eye went the Glance of its Fire, as Light doth from fire: and in this Glance of its owne Fire, the Eternall Image (which is in the wiſdome of God) was ſeen and conceived by the will of the Heart of God in the ſecond Principle: that is, by the word <hi>Fiat</hi> of the ſecond Principle, in the Love and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Holy Trinity, whence the Holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And thus the ſoule was a whole ſimilitude and Image of the Holy Trinity: here we muſt take the ſoule for the Center of Nature, and its fiery Life for the firſt Principle: but the ſprout, or the Image of the ſoule, which is a ſimilitude of God, buddeth forth from the ſoule, as a flower from the Earth, and is compriſed by the Holy Ghoſt; for it is his Manſion.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now if the ſoule put its Imagination out from it ſelfe, (wee meane out from its<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>property.</hi>
                     </note> ſource of fire) into the Light of God, then it receiveth the Light, as the Moone doth the glance of the Sunne:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61125:249"/> and ſo its Image is in the Majeſty of God, and the ſoule, in the Light of God, and its fiery Property is changed into meekneſſe and fervent Love, and then it is knowne to be the child of God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But ſeeing the ſoule is Eſſentiall, and its owne ſubſtance a Deſire; it is plaine that it conſiſts in two <hi>Fiats,</hi> one of them is its corporeall propriety, and the other is the ſecond Principle, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Gods will which is in the ſoule, in which God deſireth to have<note n="z" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it his Image and ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To which End Gods deſiring, is as a <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Centre of the ſoule, and continually draweth the will of the ſoule towards the Heart of God: for the<note n="a" place="margin">Luſt, pleaſure, will, <hi>or</hi> deſire.</note> Longing of God would have the ſoule: and on the contrary the Center in the power of the Fire would have it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For, the life of the ſoule hath its originall in the Fire, and that makes the ſtriving for the Image of the ſoule: and which of theſe two Formes whether it be the Fire, or meekneſſe of Love that overcommeth, that will be the quality of the ſoule, and as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the will of the ſoule is: ſuch an Image will the ſoule have.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And we muſt know, that if the will of the ſoule change it ſelfe, then its Forme will be alſo changed: for if the<note n="b" place="margin">Quality, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource of the ſoule be fiery, then it hath alſo a fiery Image.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But if the ſoule turne its Imagination into the Center, into the ſtrong<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>harſhnes.</hi>
                     </note> Aſtringency and bitterneſſe, then its faire Image is alſo captivated in the darke aſtrengency; and infected with the Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent wrath.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And then this wrath is a <hi>Turba,</hi> which poſſeſſeth the Image, and deſtroyeth the ſimilitude of God: for in God there is Love, Light, and meekneſſe: but in this Image there is Darkneſſe, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency and bitterneſſe, and the Eſſentiall<note n="d" place="margin">Quality, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource is fire, proceeding from the Eſſences of wrath; and then this Image belongeth not to the Kingdome of God, ſo long as it continueth in this<note n="e" place="margin">Quality, condition, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource and forme in the Darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Fire is a further ſimilitude of the ſoule: the ſoule is an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Fire, and the flaſh of the Fire is the Life of it: The ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth a Globe, or an Eye of Fire.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The burning Fire in the ſource ſignifieth the firſt Principle, and the Life, yet the Fire is not the Life: but the Spirit of the ſource which ariſeth from the Fire, and goeth forth from the firelike Aire, that is the true Spirit of the ſource of the Life of the Fire, which continually bloweth the fire up again, and maketh it burne.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Now the fire ſhineth, and giveth Light out of the ſource, and dwelleth in the ſource where it ſhineth: and the ſource compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth not the Light, and this ſignifieth the ſecond Principle, wherein God dwelleth.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:61125:250"/>19. For we know that the<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                     </note> Power is in the Light, and not in the Fire, the fire onely giveth Eſſences to the Light, and the Life, or the Light produceth meekneſſe and ſubſtantiality, <hi>viz.</hi> water.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now we underſtand, that there is a<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> amiable, Loving.</note> meeke Life in the Light, without<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                     </note> ſource, and yet it ſelfe is an inſenſible<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                     </note> ſource, it is nothing but a Longing, or deſire of Love.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Which Source we account a Tincture, in which the budding and bloſſoming hath its Originall, yet the Fire is the cauſe of it, and the meekneſſe is a cauſe of the ſubſtantiality: for the Deſire of Love in the Light attracteth it, and keepeth it, ſo that it becommeth a ſubſtance, but the Deſire of Fire conſumeth the ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Alſo we muſt conceive that, (as the ſoule is purely and alone in the Center) it is an Eſſentiall Fire in the Eye of Eternity, and yet that Eye deſireth a figure and Image of the wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And the Image is in its deſire, in its Imagination, for the<note n="i" place="margin">Verbum fiat.</note> word <hi>Fiat</hi> hath comprehended it, that it might be a ſimilitude of the Eternall wiſdome of God, wherein he dwelleth, and wherein he may manifeſt himſelfe by his Spirit, and what ever hath been in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Counſell.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus the Majeſty of God flameth in the Image, in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Fire, if the Eſſentiall Fire putteth its deſire into the Majeſty, but if not, then the Image is<note n="k" place="margin">Voyd, <hi>or</hi> empty.</note> raw and naked without God, and the Tincture is falſe.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For the Image is in the Tincture, and hath its originall in the Tincture, in the Light, not in the ſource of the Fire: and as the Heart or word of God hath its Originall in the Light of the Majeſty, in the Eternall Tincture of the fire of the Father, ſo hath the Image of the ſoule,</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Indeed the Image dwelleth in the fire of the ſoule, as Light dwelleth in the Fire, but it hath another Principle, as the Light is ſuch a ſource as is different from Fire.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And ſo the true Image of God dwelleth in the Light of the Fire of the ſoule; which Light the fiery ſoule muſt create in the fountaine of the Love of God, in the Majeſty, by putting and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding its Imagination into it.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And if the ſoule doe not ſo, but putteth its Imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe, into its wrathfull forme of the ſource of the fire, and not into the fountaine of Love, into the Light of God, then its owne ſource of<note n="l" place="margin">Sterneſſe, ſharpneſſe, <hi>or</hi> eagerneſſe.</note> fourcneſſe, aſtringency, and bitterneſſe riſeth up: and the Image of God becommeth a <hi>Turba,</hi> and ſwalloweth up the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God in the wrath.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And then the Aſtringent <hi>Fiat</hi> in the fiery Eſſence of the ſoule, figureth for the ſoule an Image, of the Imagination that is in its will: whatſoever the Eſſentiall fire of the ſoule deſireth, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61125:250"/> will be figured in the ſoule; <hi>viz.</hi> Earthly Figures: that which the will of the Heart caſteth it ſelfe into, that Image the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the ſoule will make: that is, as farre as the third Principle, and the Spirit of the Starres and Elements hath power.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. So that if the will of the ſoule doe caſt it ſelfe into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, then the outward Kingdome hath power to bring its Imagination into the inward Principle, and if the inward <hi>Fiat</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in the fire of the ſoule, then it becommeth pregnant with it, and keepeth it.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And then the ſoule hath the Image of a Beaſt in the third Principle, and that cannot be deſtroyed for ever, except the will of the ſoule returne againe out of the earthly Luſt, and pierce into the Love of God againe, and then it getteth the Image of God againe: which may be done onely in this life, while the ſoule is Eſſentially in its<note n="m" place="margin">Ground, <hi>or</hi> ſoyle, <hi>or</hi> bed of Earth.</note> Ether, in the growing of its Tree: but after this Life it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Thus you may underſtand what the ſoule, Spirit, Image, and <hi>Turba</hi> are the ſoule dwelleth in it ſelfe, and is an Eſſentiall Fire, and its Image ſtandeth in it ſelfe, in the Imagination in the Light of the ſoule, if it cleave to God, if not, then it is in Anxiety in the wrath of darkneſſe, and is an<note n="n" place="margin">Vizard, <hi>or</hi> Monſter.</note> abominable Image, or an Image of the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. The <hi>Turba</hi> of the ſoule which deſtroyeth the Divine Image, is the Eſſentiall wrathfulneſſe, and it is cauſed by the Imagination, or falſe Love, and<note n="o" place="margin">Or <hi>Imaging.</hi>

                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> For, there are many that ſeeke Myſteries and hidden knowledge, meerely that they might be reſpected, and highly eſteemed the world; and for their owne gaine and profit: but they attaine not this ground, where the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God: as it is written.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> It muſt be a totally reſigned and yeilded will, in which God himſelfe ſearcheth and worketh, and which continually pierceth into God, in yeilding and reſigned Humility, ſeeking nothing but his Eternall Native Country, and to doe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſervice with it: and then it may be attained: and he muſt begin with effectuall Repentance and amendment, and with prayer that his underſtanding might be opened from within; for, then the inward will bring it ſelfe into the outward.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> But when he readeth ſuch writings and yet cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, he muſt not preſently throw them away, and thinke it is impoſſible to underſtand them: no, but he muſt turne his minde to God, beſeeching him for Grace and underſtanding, and reade againe, and then he ſhall ſee more and more in them, till at length he be drawne by the Power of God into the very depth it ſelfe, and ſo come into the ſupernaturall and ſuper-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ground, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Eternall unity of God; where hee ſhall heare unſpeakable and effectuall words of God which ſhall bring him back and outward againe (by the Divine Effluence) to the very groſſeſt and meaneſt matter of the Earth, and then back and inwards to God againe: then the Spirit of God ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things with him, and by him, and ſo he is rightly taught and driven by God.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OSES</hi> ſaith: the Lord our God is but one onely God.

And in another: through his Word are all things made, that are made: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay that he is the Originall of all things. He is the Eternall unmeaſurable unity.</p>
                  <p n="15">15.

                  <p n="16">16. So likewiſe, when I think with my ſelf what is many hundred thouſand miles above the ſtarry Firmament: Or what is in that place
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61125:255" rendition="simple:additions"/> where no Creature is.

                     <p n="18">18. And as we ſee that Fire Light and Aire ariſe from a Candle, (though the Candle be none of the three but a cauſe of them) ſo likewiſe the Eternall unity is the cauſe and ground of the Eternall Trinity,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="25">25. In this working feelingneſſe, the Magneticall deſiring will is elevated and made joyfull, and goeth forth from the working Power and vertue, and hence commeth the growing and ſmell of the<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>formeth.</hi>

                     <p n="26">26. If there were not ſuch a deſiring feelingneſſe, and outgoing, working of the Trinity in the Eternall unity, the unity were but an Eternall ſtilneſſe; a Nothing; and there would be no Nature, nor any Colour ſhape or figure: likewiſe there would be nothing in this world, without this threefold working, no, there could be no world at all.</p>

                     <p n="29">29.

The ſecond Property of the Eternall Nature ariſeth from the firſt, and it is the drawing or Motion in the ſharpneſſe: for, the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net maketh hardneſſe; but the motion breaketh the hardneſſe again, and is a continuall ſtrife in it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. For, that which the Deſire compreſſeth and maketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the motion cutteth aſunder and divideth, ſo that it commeth into formes and Images: between theſe two Properties ariſeth the bitter<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                           </note> woe: that is, the ſting of perceivingneſſe, and feelingneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="74">74. For when there is a Motion in the ſharpneſſe, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>painfull.</hi>
                           </note> Aking, and this is alſo the cauſe of feelingneſſe and paine: for, if there were no ſharpneſſe and motion, there would be no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe this motion is alſo a ground of the Aire in the viſible world, which is manifeſted by the Fire; as ſhall be mentioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. Thus we underſtand that the Deſire is the ground of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſſe, ſo that ſomething may come out of Nothing: and thus we may alſo conceive that the Deſire hath been the Beginning of this world, by which God hath brought all things into ſubſtance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for the Deſire is that by which God ſaid<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>Fiat.</hi>

                        <p n="77">77. The third Property of the Eternall Nature is the Anguiſh <hi>viz.</hi> that<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Velle.</hi>
                           </note> Will which hath brought it ſelfe into the receivingneſſe to Nature and ſomethingneſſe: when the owne will ſtandeth in the ſharpe motion, then it commeth into Anguiſh, that is, into feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for, without Nature it is not<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>feeling.</hi>
                           </note> feelable, but in the moveable ſharpneſſe it becommeth feeling.</p>
                        <p n="78">78. And this feelingneſſe is the cauſe of the Fire, and alſo of the mind and Senſes: for the owne Naturall will is made volatile by it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61125:259"/> and ſeeketh Reſt: and thus the ſeparation of the will goeth out from it ſelfe; and pierceth through the Properties, from whence the taſte ariſeth, ſo that one Propertie taſteth and feeleth the other.</p>
                        <p n="79">79. It is alſo the ground and cauſe of the Senſes, in that one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty penetrateth into the other, and kindleth the other, ſo that the will knoweth whence the paſſiveneſſe commeth: for, if feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were not, the will could know nothing of the Properties, for it were meerely alone: and thus the Will receiveth Nature into it by feeling the ſharp motion in it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. This motion is in it ſelf like a turning wheele; not that there is ſuch a turning and winding; but it is ſo in the Properties; for, the Deſire attracteth into it ſelfe, and the Motion thruſteth forwards out of it ſelfe; and ſo the will being in this anguiſh, can neither get inwards nor outwards, and yet is drawen both out of it ſelfe, and into it ſelfe; and ſo it remaineth in ſuch a<note n="l" place="margin">forme, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>or</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Poſture, as will into it ſelfe and out of it ſelfe, (that is, over it ſelfe and under it ſelfe;) and yet can goe no whither, but is an Anguiſh: and the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hell, and of Gods Anger; for this Anguiſh ſtandeth in the darke ſharp Motion.</p>

                           </note> Nature was produced out of this ground: which Sulphur-Spirit is the Naturall Life of the earthly and Elementary Creatures.</p>

                        <p n="84">84.

                        <p n="87">87. The fourth Property of the Eternall Nature is the Spirituall Fire, wherein the Light; that is, the unity, is made manifeſt: for the<note n="x" place="margin">Shining, <hi>or</hi> Luſter <hi>or</hi> brightneſſe.</note> Glance of the fire, ariſeth and proceedeth from the outflowne unity, which hath incorporated and united it ſelfe with the Naturall Deſire: and the burning property of fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heat procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the ſharp devouringneſſe of the firſt three Properties, which commeth to be ſo as followeth.</p>
                        <p n="88">88. The Eternall unity (which I alſo in ſome of my writings, call the Liberty) is the ſoft and ſtill tranquility, being amiable, and as a ſoft comfortable eaſe, and it cannot be expreſſed how ſoft a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility there is without Nature in the unity of God: But the three Properties (in order) to Nature are ſharp, painefull, and horrible.</p>
                        <p n="89">89. In theſe three painefull Properties the outflowne will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and is produced by the word or Divine Breathing; and the unity alſo is therein, therefore the Will longeth Earneſtly for the unity, and the unity longeth for the feelingneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for the fiery ground: thus the one longeth to get into the other; and when this Longing is, there is as it were a<note n="y" place="margin">Scraſhing.</note> cracking noyſe or flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as when we rub ſteele and a ſtone together, or power water into fire; this we ſpeake by way of ſimilitude.</p>
                        <p n="90">90. In that Flaſh the unity feeleth the feelingneſſe, and the will receiveth the ſoft tranquill unity: and ſo the unity becomes a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Glance of Fire, and the fire becommeth a burning Love; for it receiveth<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>Entity.</hi>
                           </note> the <hi>Ens,</hi> and power from the ſoft unity: in this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the darkneſſe of the Magneticall compreſſure is pierced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61125:260" rendition="simple:additions"/> through with the Light, ſo that it is no more known or diſcerned, although it remaineth in it ſelfe Eternally in the compreſſure.</p>
                        <p n="91">91. Now two Eternall Principles ariſe here, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, harſhneſſe, ſharpneſſe, and paine dwelling in it ſelfe: and the feeling power and vertue of the unity in the Light: upon which the Scripture ſaith, that God, (that is, the Eternall unity) dwelleth in a Light to which none can<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>approach.</hi>
                           </note> come.</p>
                        <p n="92">92. For ſo the Eternall uity of God manifeſteth it ſelfe through the Spirituall Fire, in the Light: and this Light is called Majeſty; and God, (that is the Supernaturall unity) is the Power and vertue of it.</p>
                        <p n="93">93. For the Spirit of this Fire receiveth <hi>Ens</hi> [or vertue] to ſhine, from the unity, or elſe this fiery<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                           </note> ground would be but a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, horrible hunger, and pricking deſire: and it is ſo indeed, when the will breaketh it ſelfe off from the unity, and will live, after its owne deſire, as the Devils have done, and the falſe ſoule ſtill doth.</p>
                        <p n="94">94. And thus you may here perceive two Principles, the firſt, is the ground of the burning of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſharp moving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable painfull darkneſſe in it ſelfe: and the ſecond is the Light of the Fire, wherein the unity commeth into mobility and Joy: for, the Fire is an object of the great Love of Gods unity.</p>
                        <p n="95">95. For, ſo the Eternall Delight becommeth perceiveable, and this perceiving of the unity is called Love, and is a Burning or Life, in the unity of God: and according to this burning of Love, God calleth himſelfe a mercifull loving God: for the unity of God loveth and pierceth through the<note n="c" place="margin">Akeing.</note> painfull will of the Fire: (which at the beginning, aroſe in the breathing of the word, or outgoing of the Divine Delight) and changeth it into great Joy.</p>
                        <p n="96">96. And in this fiery will of the Eternall Nature ſtandeth the ſoule of Man, and alſo the Angels: this is their ground and Center: therefore, if any ſoule breake it ſelfe off from the Light and Love of God, and entreth into its owne Naturall Deſire; then the ground of this darkneſſe and painfull<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>ſource.</hi>
                           </note> property will be manifeſt in it: and this is the helliſh Fire, and the Anger of God, when it is made manifeſt, as may be ſeene in <hi>Lucifer:</hi> and whatſoever can be thought to have a Being<note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Or</hi> every where.</note> any where in the Creature, the ſame is likewiſe without the Creature every where: for, the Creature is nothing elſe but an Image and Figure of the ſeparable and various power, and vertue of the univerſall Being.</p>
                        <p n="97">97 Now underſtand aright what the ground of Fire is, <hi>viz.</hi> Cold, from the Compreſſure and heate from the Anguiſh, and the Motion is the<note n="f" place="margin">

                           <hi>Vulcan:</hi> in theſe three the Fire conſiſteth; but the ſhining of the Light ariſeth and proceedeth from the conjunction of the unity in the ground of Fire; and yet the whole ground is but the outflowne will.</p>

                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61125:261"/>98. Therefore in Fire and Light conſiſteth the Life of all things, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the will thereof) let them be<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> or <hi>dumb.</hi>

                        <p n="102">102. Alſo the ſoule commeth to be damned thus, when the fiery will breaketh it ſelfe off from the Love and unity of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into its owne Naturall Propriety, that is, into its evill proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: this ought further to be conſidered.</p>

                        <p n="110">110. This threefold manifeſtation is according to the Trinity; for the Centre wherein it is, is the onely God according to his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation: the fiery flaming Spirit of Love is that which goeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the meekneſſe which proceedeth from the Love is that which goeth downwards, and in the midſt there is the Center [<note n="l" place="margin">Or</note> of] the circumference, which is the Father, or whole God according to his manifeſtation.</p>

Alſo we ſee in this hunger, the Impregnation of the <hi>Archae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (that is, of the Seperator) how the undermoſt <hi>Archaeus</hi> of the Earth attracteth the uttermoſt ſubtile <hi>Archaeus</hi> from the Conſtellations above the Earth: where this compacted ground from the uppermoſt <hi>Archaeus,</hi> longeth for its ground againe and putteth it ſelfe forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the uppermoſt: in which putting forth, the growing of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61125:267" rendition="simple:additions"/> Plants and Trees, hath its Originall.</p>
                     <p n="177">177. For, the <hi>Archaeus</hi> of the Earth becommeth thereby excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joyfull, becauſe it taſteth and feeleth its firſt ground in it ſelfe againe: and in this Joy all things<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> grow.</note> ſpring out of the Earth: yes, therein alſo the growing of Animals conſiſteth, <hi>viz.</hi> in a continuall Conjunction of the Heavenly and Earthly, in which the Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vertue alſo worketh as may be knowne by the Tincture of the Vegetables in their Inward Ground.</p>
                     <p n="178">178. Therefore Man, who is ſo noble an Image, having his ground in time and Eternity; ſhould well conſider himſelfe, and not run headlong in ſuch blindneſſe, ſeeking his Native Country afarre off from himſelfe, when it is within himſelfe, though covered with the groſſeneſſe of the Elements by their ſtrife.</p>
                     <p n="179">179. Now when the ſtrife of the Elements ceaſeth, by the Death of the groſſe body, then the Spirituall Man will be made manifeſt whether he be borne in and to Light or Darkneſſe; which of theſe [two] beareth the ſway and hath the dominion in him, the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man hath his being in it Eternally, whether it be in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Anger, or in his Love.</p>
                     <p n="180">180. For, the outward viſible Man is not now the Image of God, it is nothing but an Image of the <hi>Archaeus;</hi> that is, a houſe [or huske] of the Spirituall Man, in which the ſpirituall Man groweth; as Gold doth in the<note n="f" place="margin">

                     <p n="181">181. The outward groſſe Body of the foure Elements ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, but that which is borne out of that one Element, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Divine Manifeſtation and working.</p>
                     <p n="182">182. For, this of the Fleſh and of the will of man is not it: but that which is wrought by the heavenly <hi>Archaeus</hi> in this groſſe Body, unto which this groſſe [body] is a houſe Toole and Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p n="183">183. But when the Cruſt is taken away, then it ſhall appeare wherefore we have here been called Men; and yet ſome of us have ſcarce been beaſts, may ſome far worſe then Beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="184">184. For, we ſhould rightly conſider what the Spirit of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world is, it is a houſe huske, and Inſtrument of the Inward Spirituall world which is hidden therein, and worketh through it, and ſo bringeth it ſelfe into figures and Images.</p>
                     <p n="185">185. And thus humane Reaſon is but a<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>dwelling.</hi>

                     <p n="188">188. God is the Eternall, Immenſe Incomprehenſible unity which manifeſteth it ſelfe in it selfe from Eternity in Eternity by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and is Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, in a threefold working, as is before mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="189">189. The firſt Effluence and manifeſtation of this Trinity is the Eternall word, or outſpeaking of the Divine power and vertue.</p>
                     <p n="190">190. The firſt outſpoken Subſtance from that Power is the Divine wiſdome; which is a ſubſtance wherein the Power worketh.</p>
                     <p n="191">191. Out of the wiſdome floweth the Power and vertue of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathing, and goeth into ſeparability and forming; and therein the Divine Power is manifeſt in its vertue.</p>
                     <p n="102">102. Theſe ſeparable Powers and vertues bring themſelves into receivingneſſe, to their owne perceivingneſſe; and out of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivingneſſe ariſeth owne ſelfe-will and Deſire: this owne Will is the Ground of the Eternall Nature, and it bringeth it ſelfe, with the Deſire into the Properties as farre as Fire.</p>
                     <p n="193">193. In the Deſire is the Originall of Darkneſſe: and in the Fire the Eternall unity is made manifeſt with the Light, in the fiery Nature.</p>
                     <p n="194">194. Out of this fiery Property and the property of the Light, the Angels and ſoules have their Originall; which is a Divine Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.</p>
                     <p n="195">195. The Power and vertue of Fire and Light is called Tincture; and the Motion of this vertue is called the holy and Pure Element.</p>
                     <p n="196">196. The Darkneſſe becommeth ſubſtantiall in it ſelfe: and the Light becommeth alſo ſubſtantiall in the fiery Deſire: theſe two make two Principles: <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Anger in the Darkneſſe, and Gods Love in the Light, each of them worketh in it ſelfe, and there is onely ſuch a difference between them as between Day and Night, and yet both of them have but one onely Ground, and the one is alwayes a cauſe of the other, and that the other becommeth manifeſt and knowne in it, as Light from fire.</p>
                     <p n="197">197. The viſible world is the third Principle, that is, the third
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61125:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ground and beginning; this is outbreathed out of the Inward Ground, (<hi>viz.</hi> out of both the firſt Principles) and brought into the Nature and forme of a Creature.</p>
                     <p n="198">198. The Inward Eternall working is hidden in the viſible world, and it is in every thing and through every thing, yet not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehened by any thing in the things owne Power; the outward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and vertues are but the paſſive and the houſe, in which the Inward doe worke.</p>

                     <p n="200">200. The Eternall Manifeſtation of the Divine Light is called the Kingdome of Heaven, and the Habitation of the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Soules.</p>
                     <p n="201">201. The fiery Darkneſſe is called Hell, or Gods Anger, wherein the Devills dwell, together with the damned ſoules.</p>

                     <p n="210">210. THe Word Science is not ſo taken by me as men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word <hi>Scientia</hi> in the Latine Tongue, for I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand therein even the true Ground according to Senſe, which both in the Latine and all other Languages is miſſed and neglected by Ignorance: for every word in its Impreſſure forming and Expreſſion, gives the true underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of what that thing is that is ſo called.</p>
                     <p n="211">211. You underſtand by Science ſome skill or knowledge: in which you ſay true, but doe not fully expreſſe the meaning.</p>
                     <p n="212">212. Science is the Root to the underſtanding, as to the<note n="o" place="margin">Cogitation, conſideration, <hi>or,</hi> Reaſoning.</note> Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: it is the Root to the Center of the<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>forming.</hi>
                        </note> Impreſſure of Nothing into ſomething: as when the will of the Abyſſe attracteth it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe, to a Center of the Impreſſure (<hi>viz.</hi> to the word) then ariſeth the true underſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="213">213. The will is in the Separability of the Science, and there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth it ſelfe out from the Impreſſed Compaction; and men firſt of all underſtand the Eſſence in that which is ſeparated, in which the Separability impreſſeth it ſelfe into a Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="214">214. For<note n="q" place="margin">ESSENTZ.</note> Eſſence is a ſubſtantiall power and vertue, but Science is a moving flitting one, like the Senſes; it is indeed the Root of the Senſes.</p>
                     <p n="215">215. Yet in the underſtanding, in which it is called Science, it is not the ſenſing, but a cauſe of the ſenſing, in that manner as when the Underſtanding impreſſeth it ſelfe in the Mind, there muſt firſt be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61125:269"/> a cauſe which muſt give the Mind, from which the underſtanding floweth forth into its Contemplation: Now this Science is the Root to the fiery Mind, and it is in briefe the Root of all Spirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, it is the true Root of Soules and proceedeth through every Life, for it is the Ground from whence Life commeth.</p>
                     <p n="216">216. I could not give it any other better Name, this doth ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accord and agree in the ſenſe: for the Science is the cauſe that the Divine Abyſſall Will compacteth and impreſſeth it ſelfe into Nature, to the ſeparable [various] intelligible and perceivable Life of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and difference: for the Impreſſure of the Science, (whereby the will attracteth it into it ſelfe) the Naturall Life ariſeth and the word of every Life Originally.</p>
                     <p n="217">217. The diſtinction or ſeparation out of the Fire, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as followeth. The Eternall Science in the Will of the Father draweth the Will (which is called Father) into it ſelfe, and ſhutteth it ſelfe into a Center of the Divine Generation of the Trinity, and by the Science ſpeaketh it ſelfe forth into a word of underſtanding; and in the ſpeaking is the Separation in the Science: and in every Separation there is the Deſire to the Impreſſure of the<note n="r" place="margin">Or <hi>outſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
                        </note> Expreſſion, the Impreſſure is Eſſentiall, and is called Divine Eſſence.</p>
                     <p n="218">218. From this eſſence the word<note n="r" place="margin">Or <hi>outſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
